<div class="chapter nobreak">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="p75">WHITE VS. RED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Crack!</span> crack!” rung out the reports of two rifles over
the calm bosom of the lake, and two canoes, about fifty rods
apart, seemed to leap from the water as they sped forward.</p>

<p>The course of both canoes was toward the western shores
of the bay forming the north-western portion of Lake Erie.
The one behind was manned by five Indian warriors, two of
whom had just fired upon the boat ahead, which contained two
persons—a white man and an Indian. The bullets, however,
had no other effect than to cut the water at the distance of
several yards to the right of the pursued men.</p>

<p>“S’pose you take rifle now, Scarred Eagle?” said the Indian
to his white companion.</p>

<p>“No, not yit, Goodbrand,” said the other. “Thar’s little
danger of the devils hittin’ us yit, but they want to make us
lose time. Five oars ag’in’ two is gre’t odds, with a mile still
afore us. Pull for y’ur life?”</p>

<p>The speaker was a man past forty years of age, with proportions
denoting great strength and agility. Evidently, he had
been through many rough scenes of border-life, for nearly every
part of his body visible showed the marks of wounds. The
most conspicuous of these was upon his face, one side of
which was an entire scar. From this circumstance, he was
called “Scarred Eagle” by the Indians, who had long since
learned both to fear and respect him. But his face, though
disfigured, was not wanting in expression. In fact, there was
something of dignity in his bearing. No stranger would meet
the clear gray eye, and note the bold, frank style of the man’s
speech, without feeling that he was in the presence of one of
nature’s noblemen, indeed. His dress was after the prevailing
style of bordermen; and we note but one peculiarity. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
hunting-frock was decorated on the breast by a design in bead-work
representing a man in the act of silently bearing a white
female prisoner from the midst of some sleeping Indians.</p>

<p>The Indian who assisted in propelling the canoe was not
so tall as his white friend, though dressed nearly like him.
He was a noble-looking savage, and had learned to speak the
English tongue with considerable fluency.</p>

<p>A few words will explain the meaning of the situation in
which we find these two men.</p>

<p>Both belonged to a body of scouts hovering near the besieged
garrison at Detroit. They had, in the present instance,
been scouting alone on the neck of land between Erie and St.
Clair lakes. Being discovered by a party of Indians, they had
retreated to the lake, and embarked in the canoe which had
brought them from the opposite side of the bay already mentioned.
But the Indians had found a canoe and started in
pursuit before our friends were half a mile away. And at
the moment we have introduced them, this distance had been
lessened, so that hardly fifty rods now separated them.</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle and his Indian friend were not wanting in
skill in the management of their craft. They knew the pursuers
were fast gaining on them; yet they hoped to avoid a
close struggle on the water, over which the gloom of night was
fast settling. It was yet nearly a mile to the shore, however,
and the shots which came every few seconds from their enemies,
began to whizz alarmingly near.</p>

<p>“It’s time ter pay back, Goodbrand,” said Scarred Eagle, at
length. “I hate ter begin, ’cos it’ll hinder our speed an’ give
them bloody rascals an advantage.”</p>

<p>“S’pose you no do now, <em>have</em> to bimeby,” returned the Indian.
“Mebbe kill some now; den not so many to fight if
come up.”</p>

<p>“Thet’s a good plan enough, allowin’ I kin dew it, Goodbrand.
But they’ll dodge down likely, jest as we do. Howsumever,
I’ll try it. Ha! down with ye ag’in!”</p>

<p>The warning was not a moment too soon; for as they dodged
down into the canoe-bottom, two or three reports rung out, and
this time the bullets spun directly over them.</p>

<p>“Ay, Goodbrand; now keep ’er stidy’s ye kin, while I see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>what kin be done.”</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle, while thus speaking, dropped the paddle and
snatched up his rifle, which was leveled and discharged with
surprising quickness. A cry of pain answered the report of
the weapon, and one of the pursuers fell back, never to use
oar again! Goodbrand gave utterance to a shout of triumph.</p>

<p>“Ha, Scarred Eagle, dey find out <em>who</em> shoot now, mebbe,”
he said, though without relaxing for a moment his exertions
at the paddle.</p>

<p>“Thar’s <em>one</em> less, sartin,” replied Scarred Eagle, “but they’ve
gained fast on us fur the last minit. We’ll keep frum close
quarters as long as we kin.”</p>

<p>Before the pursuers had fully recovered from their confusion,
the white marksman had reloaded his rifle. He kept a sharp
watch upon those behind, while his Indian friend, with bared
bosom and arms, was reeking with sweat, as he strained every
muscle to his work.</p>

<p>Scarce thirty rods now separated the canoes, and the pursuers
were, every one, using a paddle. Scarred Eagle again
jerked his rifle to a poise; but, quick as was the movement,
the Indians crouched down, leaving but little of their bodies
exposed, though still managing to propel their canoe.</p>

<p>The white man, still keeping watch upon the enemy, snatched
up a paddle and assisted his Indian friend. But he was
not permitted to do so long. One of their foes rose suddenly
and fired, the ball grazing Goodbrand’s shoulder as he stooped,
and for the first time during the chase, four ringing war-whoops
from those behind echoed over the lake-waters.</p>

<p>“No—no—not yit, Goodbrand!” cried Scarred Eagle, as he
saw the Indian about to draw in his paddle. “Save y’ur shot
till it comes closer quarters. ’Tain’t more’n a quarter of a
mile furder to shore—we must leasten it all we kin.”</p>

<p>The white man spoke hurriedly, though no trepidation could
have been noticed in his voice. He himself, taking advantage
of the few seconds allowed, was working with giant strength
at the paddle. But, as before, the Indians, upon noticing his
work, determined to stop it and draw his fire. Two of them
fired together this time, and one of the balls plowed a slight
furrow across the top of Goodbrand’s head!</p>

<p>Hardly had the echoes of the reports ceased when Scarred
Eagle sprung up and leveled his rifle. Its report was followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
by jeering cries from the pursuers, who redoubled their exertions
at the oars.</p>

<p>“That <em>’ar</em> was wasted through your whirlin’ round an’
rockin’ the canoe so sudden, Goodbrand,” said Scarred Eagle,
with chagrin in his tone. “Ah!” he immediately added, as
his quick glance fell upon his friend’s head, “struck, war ye?
Wal, it’s no use puttin’ things off longer. Take y’ur rifle.”</p>

<p>The other did so, suffering the canoe to float idly on the
water, while his white companion was hurriedly reloading.
But the latter had not time to finish the work. Not more
than forty yards now separated the canoes, and the occupants
of the hindmost had also ceased their labors, preparing for the
struggle. Two of them suddenly rose, and <em>three</em> reports rung
out simultaneously. The shot of Goodbrand told with good
effect, for one of his enemies fell back into the lake. He himself
was merely grazed; but his white friend, Scarred Eagle,
uttered a deep groan and fell headlong beneath the waters of
the lake!</p>

<p>The Indian, Goodbrand, could not repress an exclamation of
sorrow. He was as deeply attached to Scarred Eagle as though
the latter had been an own brother. But now, the career of
his friend seemed ended.</p>

<p>The faithful fellow was almost on the point of throwing
himself into the lake after his friend. But the exultant yells
of his enemies roused in him that instinct of revenge so characteristic
of his race. He had no chance to reload his rifle,
for the other canoe was now but a few yards distant, and he
knew three Miami warriors were ready to shoot him the moment
he should rise.</p>

<p>Goodbrand himself was a Miami Indian. He had been
converted years before, by the Moravian missionaries, and had
only departed from their teachings in that he took up the hatchet
of war, in behalf of the white race whom he loved. For
this reason he was an outcast from his tribe, and had no hopes
of other than a cruel death, in the event of falling alive into
their hands.</p>

<p>As the canoe of the others came nearer, Goodbrand grasped
knife and hatchet in either hand, fully determined not to be
taken alive.</p>

<p>He had not been more than a few seconds thus prepared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
when the appalling war-whoops of his enemies were suddenly
hushed, and groans burst out, quickly followed by a splashing
in the water. Quickly he raised his head and saw, not more
than twenty feet away, the canoe of his pursuers <em>bottom upward</em>,
while two of its late occupants were disappearing beneath
the water! Another moment, and the form of Scarred
Eagle rose from the water, surging toward him!</p>

<p>“Push up, Goodbrand, push up,” said Scarred Eagle, in a
panting voice. And in less time than what we occupy in
describing it, the Indian had assisted his friend into the canoe.</p>

<p>For a few moments the latter could hardly speak, and
Goodbrand, comprehending the work he had done, merely uttered
an exclamation of joy as his keen eyes watched for the
reappearance of their foes.</p>

<p>“I knifed two on ’em the minit I riz up side o’ thar skiff,
Goodbrand,” said Scarred Eagle, with a shiver in his voice.
“<em>Them</em> won’t mislest us more, but t’other one’s hangin’ ter the
canoe yender.”</p>

<p>Already had his Indian friend seen this, and seizing the
paddle began to sweep up toward the drifting canoe. But
suddenly, Scarred Eagle interposed.</p>

<p>“Let the poor devil go, Goodbrand,” he said. “He kain’t
dew us any hurt, an’ it seems like a cruel advantage to take
by sich as we.”</p>

<p>“Good!” assented the other. “It shall be as my brother
says, ’cos he wise head as well as quick hand. He has saved
us both. He is an Eagle that can fly under water, as well as
over the land.”</p>

<p>“I seen ’twas best course, considerin’ the fix we war in,”
replied the other as he began to wring the water from his
clothes. “It come to me all of a sudden like. Ah—thar’s
the cretur’ in sight,” he added, as the head and shoulders of
the remaining enemy appeared on the opposite side of the
receding canoe.</p>

<p>“It is Nookechin—one of my cousins,” exclaimed Goodbrand
in surprise. “I’m glad no to kill him, though kill me, mebbe.”</p>

<p>“An’ I’m glad tu hear ye say it, Goodbrand,” answered
Scarred Eagle. “It shows you’ve a Christian heart, an’ that
the Moravians hevn’t labored on ye in vain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Workechin likes not to war upon his own race, and only
does so when necessary to defend his white friends,” replied
the other, assuming for the moment his Indian name. “He
believes in the white God and white ways; and wishes his
own tribe would believe likewise. They would be more
happy then. Nookechin,” he added, elevating his voice, and
using his native tongue, “you see we spare your life. I hope
never to have occasion to meet you nor any other of my kin
or tribe in battle, for I would not harm them. Does Nookechin
hear?”</p>

<p>“It is well,” answered the other. “I shall not forget this
kindness from my cousin. I will never fight against him till
I do him as good a turn.” And, as if fully confident of the
good intentions of the others, he righted the canoe and sprung
into it. Then, grasping a paddle which floated near, he made
a gesture of good-will toward his late enemies, and began to
push rapidly toward the northern shore.</p>

<p>“What now, Scarred Eagle?” asked Goodbrand, as he
peered toward the western shore now barely discernible
through the gloom. “Mebbe our friends hear us fight—mebbe
Injuns hear too.”</p>

<p>“Y’ur right,” said the other. “Lay ’er off sou’-west a trifle
an’ we’ll try ter steal ashore under kiver of the darkness.”</p>

<p>Goodbrand obeyed, taking a course that would land them
some distance below the point from which they had embarked.
Though prudent himself, he instinctively deferred to
the judgment of his white friend. And there were but few
along the border who did not place more confidence in the
opinions of Scarred Eagle than in their own.</p>

<p>The latter, while his friend pushed forward the canoe, reloaded
his trusty rifle, which he had left in the canoe with his
powder-horn, at the time he feigned death. This accomplished,
he directed his gaze toward the shore.</p>

<p>“Easy, Goodbrand, easy,” he whispered, at length. “It’s
gittin’ dark, but not fast enough for our purpose onless we
move slower. That’s right—it’s better.”</p>

<p>His Indian friend had ceased to paddle, and the canoe
floated noiselessly on the water. For a quarter of an hour
neither of them spoke except in low whispers. About two
hundred yards away loomed up the great forest, stretching
away from the shore. Not a sound came from its depths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
yet they knew lurkers might lie along shore, thirsting for their
blood.</p>

<p>“It’s jest possible that we mout land safe, Goodbrand; but
’twon’t dew to trust the appearance of things hereaway,” remarked
Scarred Eagle. “Some o’ the chaps orter be expectin’
us, even ef they hain’t heard our rifles, which it is posserble
they hain’t.”</p>

<p>“S’pose you give signal,” said the Indian.</p>

<p>“We’ll steal up a little closer fust. Thar’s hardly an outline
of the shore to be seen now.”</p>

<p>Goodbrand began to push the canoe forward. Suddenly a
single peculiar note came from the forest.</p>

<p>“About with it, quick!” whispered Scarred Eagle. “It’s
Ben Mace’s signal, an’ warns of danger.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he seized another paddle, and in a moment
the canoe was gliding back from shore. Then came three or
four rifle-reports, and the bullets whistled uncomfortably near.</p>

<p>“Now, Goodbrand, we’ve got ter calkerlate clus,” remarked
Scarred Eagle, as soon as they were out of danger. “We’ve
got ter land <em>somewhar</em>. Whether furder up or down’s the
question. We’ll be watched for, cluser’n Saul watched for
David, an’ must use all the wits Proverdence has gin us.”</p>

<p>“Scarred Eagle speaks well,” replied the Indian. “S’pose
we go up. The Miami warriors are cunning. They cum from
fort-way an’ will watch above here ’cos they’ve heerd us fight.
Den we better go, hurry down.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ve come to the marrer of the thing, Goodbrand, an’
that’s what I like,” responded the other, after a moment’s
thought. “Now, won’t our enemies not reelly expict we’ll
take the very course you speak of? It strikes me they will.
They’ll reason the thing ’bout ’s you, who ar’ ecquainted
with their wiles.”</p>

<p>“I see—yis,” said Goodbrand, to whom this species of
strategy was apparently new. “Den, if say go up, we go.”</p>

<p>“We must keep well out an’ dip light,” remarked Scarred
Eagle, as he seized a paddle. “It’s sartin Mace is ’round,
an’ the rest orter be—some on ’em. All on ’em wouldn’t have
stayed at the bivo’ac. But land we must; otherwise this night-wind
’ll benumb every narve in my body.”</p>

<p>For half an hour they continued to pull northward. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the darkness deepened, they drew gradually nearer shore, and
soon their canoe touched a jut of land.</p>

<p>At this moment, a succession of sounds, muffled by distance
and intervening forests, came to their ears. Any but the experienced
ears of a scout, would have failed to understand the
significance of these sounds. But our friends knew they
were the echoes of rifle-reports.</p>

<p>“Ay, Goodbrand,” said Scarred Eagle, in a whisper, as
both glanced around through the gloom. “The rest o’ the
chaps ar’ in trouble, an’ we’re in fur it. Come!”</p>

<p>Both stepped noiselessly ashore, drew their canoe under the
densely-wooded bank, and then began to steal forward through
the gloom.</p>

<div class="chapter nobreak">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="p75">MOOROOINE.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">About</span> an hour previous to the events last described, a number
of rangers were grouped around a fire, near the termination
of a deep forest gorge. A small stream ran through the
gorge, finding an outlet at the shores of the lake, about two
miles away. At their backs rose an almost perpendicular
cliff a hundred feet in hight, covered with dense foliage. The
banks of the gorge, opposite, were comparatively low, and
supported huge trees, whose branches, shooting far out, rendered
the place gloomy even at midday.</p>

<p>A better hiding-place, or bivouac, for a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse</i> of rangers,
could not well have been chosen. An enemy might pass
within thirty yards of the place, and be none the wiser, so
far as sight or hearing is concerned. On the contrary, those
within, looking outward from comparative darkness, could
quickly discover the presence of interlopers, and withstand
attack or make a good retreat, as policy might require.</p>

<p>The rangers had not been at this bivouac long. In groups
of two, they had been watching the forest in different directions.
They had returned, according to previous arrangement,
and were now partaking heartily of rich venison-stew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
broiled on the bed of coals in their midst. They had assured
themselves that no Indians were lurking near, before
kindling the fire; yet the smoke from the hard, dry wood,
became invisible ere it reached the top of the interlaced
branches above them.</p>

<p>Little need be said in description of these men. They
were the main body of scouts mentioned in the preceding
chapter, and Scarred Eagle was their acknowledged leader.
They were all hardy-looking fellows, well-armed, and of
various ages, of uncouth appearance, rough in speech, but with
nerves of steel; ready to face danger at any moment, and not
loth to indulge in the pastime of a wrestling-match, or knock-down
among themselves, in the absence of more exciting events.</p>

<p>“Seems ter me Brom, as yer call ’im, orter showed hisself
afore now ef ’e <em>ain’t</em> got took,” remarked one of them,
a tall, coarse-looking fellow in homespun.</p>

<p>“I dun know, Hulet,” replied one of his companions, clearing
his throat. “It’s a dangerous job he ondertook—gittin’
to the fort when it’s compissed by so many Injuns. But ’e
ain’t had time. A day for twenty miles’ travel, an’ all on’t
to be <em>stole</em> over, ain’t too long, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“I know it’s dangerous. But he’s be’n gone more’n a day.
He started three hours afore this time yisterday.”</p>

<p>“An’ s’posin’ ’e did?” broke in another, of Celtic origin.
“Is dthat a sign he’s tuk? How dthe deuce are you or me to
know dthe crooks an’ turns he’s had to make? Uv wan
thing I’m certain, Brum w’u’dn’t cair for y’ur advice, nor
woon’t thank yees for y’ur unaisiness. So ye needn’t be ov
dthe first to wurry.”</p>

<p>Hulet deigned no answer to the Irishman, but resumed conversation
with the ranger first addressed.</p>

<p>“Then, you’re out on the distance tew,” he said. “It’s
sca’ce ten miles to the fort.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t, eh?” answered the one called Revel, who stopped
with a piece of venison half-way to his mouth, and eyed the
questioner. “Sca’ce ten mile! Who don’t know that?”</p>

<p>“You said, twenty.”</p>

<p>One or two of the group indulged in sneering chuckles.</p>

<p>“I say so yit,” returned Revel. “Brom’s got to pass over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>the ground <em>twice</em> afore he gits back here, ain’t ’e?”</p>

<p>“Yees needn’t ax <em>dthat</em>, Will,” said the Irishman. “Our
<em>laider</em> has swall’ed too much venison entoirely, an’ it’s druv
all dthe sinse he had in his head down to his belly. Dthe
thruth, as sure’s me father wur a docthur!”</p>

<p>The laugh which went round at Hulet’s expense, was of
course not over-relished by the latter.</p>

<p>“That ar’ ye call wit—Irish wit, I s’pose,” returned Hulet
unable to conceal anger. “But I don’ know ’bout the ‘doctor.’
Who ever heerd of a durned Irishman bein’ a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?” queried the Irishman, fiercely. “I’ll take a
joke but not an insoolt to me name, ye domd gossoon. Me
father <em>was</em> a docthur, though, an’ I, Tim Devine, am able to
docthur y’ur face, for the slandhur of y’ur tongue!” He aimed
a blow at Hulet, as he spoke, which the latter parried.</p>

<p>“Hold on—this ’ere ain’t a-goin’ to do, now,” said Revel,
rushing between them. “This ain’t the time for a row. Put
it off. We’ve got to start pretty soon for the lake-shore.
Thar may be Injuns skulking around, an’ we ain’t goin’ ter be
sech headlong fools as to direct ’em here.”</p>

<p>Tim stood back. In the absence of Scarred Eagle, Revel
was a sort of leader, and all liked him. But Tim shot fierce
glances at Hulet, who smiled tauntingly.</p>

<p>“Niver mind, aneconde,” said Tim. “We’ll hove dthis
out some time, an’ though y’ur size is something in y’ur favor,
I’ll make ye respict me name if not swalle y’ur words. See
if I don’t now, ye ill-mannered baist!”</p>

<p>“Hold up, men,” interrupted Revel. “Don’t run it into a
quarrel. That’s foolish.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want ’er quarrel, nor have no diffikilty,” said Hulet.
“But he begun it. I own I made a mistake ’bout the
distance we was talkin’ of, ’cos I didn’t at fust think.”</p>

<p>“Co-cor-course; Hulet knew better ef he’d had time ter
th-th-think. He don’t allus, ye know, bo-bo-boyes. T’other
day he mis-mis-mistook an Injun fur a black b-b-bear, jest ’cos
he didn’t hev time ter th-th-think!”</p>

<p>The stuttering speaker was a tall, spare man, with a whimsical
face, eyes keen as a hawk’s and almost as small. His
sally was greeted by a round of subdued laughter, from all
except Hulet, whose face showed more signs of anger than
had been evinced during his renconter with the Irishman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Hulet was not personally well liked by his companions. He
had been with them but a few days. He pretended to hail
from one of the border settlements, and claimed to be a scout
of much experience. One or two of the rangers held him in
positive distrust. He seemed used to the forest; yet at times
he made strange blunders for a scout. The one referred to
by the stutterer actually happened, two days previously, while
they were hovering in the rear of a Huron party.</p>

<p>“Wal, <em>laugh</em>, ef it suits ye!” said Revel, fiercely. “When
it comes my turn, I’ll let some on ye know!”</p>

<p>“What’s that ye say?” spoke Revel, turning sharply upon
him. He thought he detected something of the nature of a
threat in the other’s tone.</p>

<p>“You yerself wouldn’t want a mistake flung inter y’ur face
every time any thing comes up!” said Hulet. “But let it pass.
A chap that stutters is allus gittin’ off sunthin’ to make a laugh,”
and he tried to look good-naturedly toward the stutterer, Joe
Hill.</p>

<p>“Ex-ex-exactly!” rejoined the latter worthy. “My tongue
kine-kine-kinder hitches when I talk, an’ that’s wha-wha-whar
I git time ter th-th-think whuther an objict’s a b’ar or an In-In-Injun.”</p>

<p>None seemed disposed to interrupt Joe. They enjoyed the
badinage too well. The Irishman especially fatted at the
idea of bringing Hulet into contempt, and encouraged Joe to
keep it up. But Hulet disarmed the latter by joining slightly
in the laugh, and then addressing Will Revel:</p>

<p>“I don’t understand why Brown should resk himself to
visit the fort, now,” he said. “The major won’t care ter
make a sally afore the reinforcements come.”</p>

<p>“Old Rhodan knows what he sent ’em for,” answered
Revel. “That’s all I kin tell ye.”</p>

<p>“Ye mean him that’s called Scarred Eagle. He an’ Brown
seem to think oncommon of each other. Relashuns, ain’t
they?”</p>

<p>“Not by blood; though father and son couldn’t think more
of each other than they. Rhodan saved ’im, when he war a
striplin’, from the Hurons. They’ve stuck to one another ever
sence, as it’s nat’ral they should.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“In course. Strikes me that Scarred Eagle himself orter
be among us, ef he’s comin’ to-night. Mebbe he won’t. It’s
goin’ to be dark’s a pocket.”</p>

<p>The Irishman here nudged Joe Hill.</p>

<p>“Yis; dar-dark-darker’n the outside of a black b-b-<em>ba’r</em>,”
assented Joe, giving his face a comical twist.</p>

<p>“It’s comin’ on fast, too,” said Revel. “We must betake
ourselves to the lake-shore and watch for Scarred Eagle. Ef
he don’t come by dark we kin come back an’ wait.”</p>

<p>“Must be Ben Mace’ll come,” said another. “He hadn’t
so fur to go.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I feel a trifle oneasy ’bout <em>him</em>, Lew,” answered
Revel. “I’ll own it. He’s as good a scout as is in the kentry,
only he’s so mad at sight of an Injun. He runs too much
resk for the sake of revenge.”</p>

<p>“Why not stay whar we be?” said Hulet. “I don’t b’l’eve
Scarred Eagle ’ll git back frum the neck to-night. Thar’s no
Injuns in the neighborhood, an’ ef I kin read right it’ll be
so dark in an hour that none on us could find our way
back.”</p>

<p>“How mooch for y’ur advoice, Misthur <em>Hugelet</em>?” said Tim,
quickly. “You’re afeard of runnin’ y’ur head ag’in’ a tree or
<em>bear</em>, whuch? Dthe id’a of a scout, a syees <em>purtind</em> to be, not
bein’ able to git through the woods for darkness! Pish!”</p>

<p>“You’ll run y’ur head ag’in’ sunthin’ bimeby, Mister
Brogue,” said Hulet, “that’ll make ye—”</p>

<p>“Oh, git out!” interrupted Revel, again. “Let this foolin’
come to an end. Some o’ them that’s away may come or
not, but we’ll watch for ’em anyhow. I think Rhodan ’ll be
back. The darkness won’t stop him.”</p>

<p>“He’d find his way through te-teto-te-tle—<em>durn it</em>—tetotal
darkness blindfolded,” added Joe, spitefully.</p>

<p>“Good, Joe,” said Revel, with a laugh. “Now, boys—ah,
what’s that?”</p>

<p>He had seen a dusky figure pass by the outlet of the gorge.
Before he spoke, however, Joe Hill had sprung off with the
agility of a cat, and disappeared in the bushes hard by. The
rest grasped their rifles and followed. But they had hardly
reached the outlet of the ravine when Joe reappeared from a
side-path, leading an Indian girl, who evidently had not tried
hard to get away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“Thar!” he ejaculated, “I’ve g-got ’er, though what she
wa-wan—<em>blast it!</em>—<em>wants</em> hyur’s more’n I kin tell. Cu-curi’s
part on’t is, she did-didn’t tr-r-r-try ter git away.”</p>

<p>“Hurry out an’ look around, some of you,” said Will Revel,
quickly. “Mebbe thar’s others near.”</p>

<p>“None but me,” said the captive, in fair English.</p>

<p>All, except Hulet, gazed upon her curiously. The girl was
an Indian beauty, apparently about eighteen years of age. She
was above the medium hight, and the color of her skin showed
that white blood ran in her veins. She wore beautiful moccasins
upon her feet, and was dressed tastefully. Her hair
was glossy, black and fine, falling around her shoulders in
masses, though kept back from her forehead by a glittering
silver band. At her back was a bow and quiver of arrows;
while a light hatchet and a knife were pendent from either
side of her waist. She confronted the rangers without showing
a sign of fear, though evidently embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Why’ve ye come here, Injun girl?” asked Revel. “If it’s
to do us harm, you’re very foolish.”</p>

<p>“No come for that,” she said, earnestly.</p>

<p>“How’d ye know we war here?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t know. Looked sharp—den find you. Come
for do good. Injuns that way,” pointing toward the lake.
“You git scalps took if not careful.”</p>

<p>“Hear <em>dthat</em> now!” muttered the Irishman.</p>

<p>“Why’d ye come to warn us?” asked Revel. “Ain’t ye
afraid we’ll harm ye?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” answered the Indian girl, dropping her eyes.
“If did, would not come. Moorooine loves the white race.
Some bad, some good—so everywhere. But Moorooine loves
them and warns them. Some white herself, too.”</p>

<p>Will Revel started in surprise as he heard the girl’s name.
Two more of the group also showed surprise and looked with
new interest upon her.</p>

<p>“Who sent you here?” asked Revel.</p>

<p>“No one,” replied the Indian girl. “I followed some warriors
softly that went on trail. They found where two men
went off in canoe. Some watch for them to come back;
others search forest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“Then Scarred Eagle ’ll be in danger,” said Revel, turning
to his comrades. “Thar’s no time to lose. I’ve reason to
b’l’eve this girl’s true to us. How many ar’ along the lake-shore?”
he added, turning to Moorooine again.</p>

<p>“Me talk more with you, alone,” she said, avoiding the
bevy of eyes fixed upon her. Revel followed her a short
distance aside.</p>

<p>“There is <em>so</em> much warriors twice,” she said, in answer to
his last question, holding up both hands with the fingers
outspread. “They chased white man, but white man got
away.”</p>

<p>“Did you see the white man?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Warriors call ’im Evil Eye.”</p>

<p>“Ah—Ben Mace!” exclaimed Revel. “Did he run this
way?”</p>

<p>“Goin’ to; but had to hide. Den warriors missed ’im an’
leave behind. Look out for white friends on lake. Be careful,
an’ look out for yourselves, too. Git took if don’t.
Moorooine knows the forest an’ will help you. Mus’ go now.
Bimeby you come too.”</p>

<p>“One minit,” said Will Revel. “You come here for
more’n you say, Moorooine. I’ve heerd y’ur name afore.
Thar’s a young hunter who ginrully goes with the Scarred
Eagle. Have ye seen him called the White Fox, up to’ards the
fort?” This was the name by which Brom Vail was known
among the Indians.</p>

<p>The Indian maiden glanced curiously into the ranger’s
face, and the rich blood mounted to her cheeks and brow.</p>

<p>“Yes; seen ’im,” she answered, dropping her eyes. “He
not here, go in canoe with friend, s’pose. Me watch for
his coming an’ you watch too. Be careful. Mebbe all of
us cheat warriors an’ save him an’ friend.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our best, sartin,” said Will. “But Moorooine
is at fault. White Fox started for the fort yisterday, an’
we’re lookin’ for ’im back.”</p>

<p>The girl’s manner changed at once. A look of deep apprehension
appeared in her face.</p>

<p>“White Fox got to fort in night an’ started back early in
morning,” she said. “Me see ’im softly (secretly) outside
the fort. Much ’fraid Injuns got ’im! Too bad, very!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Her looks betrayed intense anxiety. And Revel’s was
equally great. He saw all at a glance. As intimated, he had
heard of the Miami girl, Moorooine, before. The strongest
attachment had sprung up between her and Brom Vail.
They had met a few months before, when Brom, with his
foster-father and a man of the name of Thorpe, were seeking
for information affecting the peace of the latter’s mind.
Moorooine had afforded the party successful aid, and once
saved their lives at the risk of her own.</p>

<p>“Mus’ go!” she said, suddenly. “Mus’ save White Fox
if can, an’ rest too.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be on hand, brave girl,” said Will. “If we kin
git with Scarred Eagle an’ Goodbrand we’ll find whar Brom
is, or die for’t. D’ye s’pose ye could find the Evil Eye?”</p>

<p>“Me try to, an’ den git him help. Ha!” she exclaimed,
as her keen glance shot through the bushes toward the rest
of the company. “Who <em>that</em> man?”</p>

<p>Will followed her glance, which rested upon the person
of Hulet. For the first time he noticed the latter had kept
as much as possible in the background when the Indian girl
came. Hulet had advanced a little nearer to the rest, who
had apparently noticed his conduct.</p>

<p>“That?” said Revel. “He’s a scout like the rest of us.
Does Moorooine know ’im?”</p>

<p>“<em>Most</em> do,” she answered, in a whisper, keeping her eyes
toward him. “You know ’im long?”</p>

<p>“Only a few days. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Sure now,” she whispered. “Have seen ’im ’round
fort with Injuns. Watch ’im sharp. He’s no <em>good</em> white
man. He carries two tongues an’ will betray you an’ me too
if can.”</p>

<p>“What did they call ’im?” inquired Revel, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Sly Hate. Take care <em>him</em>. Mus’ go. You know cry of
night-hawk? One, tell you ‘look out;’ two will mean, ‘come.’”
The girl turned and disappeared through the bushes toward
the lake.</p>

<p>Will stood a few moments in deep surprise. “Sly Hate,”
he muttered. “The one that was cashiered for cowardice a
year ago at Montreal, and then j’ined the Injuns. An’ he’s
here ter lead us into a trap. By the great livin’, he shain’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>play the game no further!”</p>

<p>He stalked through the bushes and approached the group
of rangers. He kept his head down so that Hulet might not
suspect his designs till the last moment. But when he came
near the men, he raised his eyes and saw that Hulet was not
present. The rest were watching his own strange approach
curiously.</p>

<p>“Phat’s come across yees?” exclaimed the Irishman.</p>

<p>“Did thet Injun gal—”</p>

<p>“Whar’s Hulet?” interrupted Revel, sternly. All glanced
around, and several spoke at once.</p>

<p>“Why ’e was here not a minit ago, ’cos—”</p>

<p>Further speech was interrupted. A rifle cracked not far
away, and one of the group, grasping his breast, fell to the
ground! The report was succeeded by a defiant shout from
Hulet, who had disappeared in the direction of the lake.</p>

<p>“It’s all over with me, boys,” gasped the stricken man.
“Go on—all of you, an’ take the traitor, and avenge my
death.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter nobreak">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="p75">TWO LESS.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Exclamations</span> of horror burst from the rangers, and the
next moment all were rapidly plunging through the bushes
after Hulet. For the time being no thought, no desire, was in
their minds other than to avenge the death of their comrade,
Lew Burns.</p>

<p>In a few moments they cleared the dense bushes surrounding
their bivouac and caught a glimpse of the traitor. He was
some forty yards away, running rapidly. Three rifles spoke
in quick succession, but the rascal kept on, unscathed. The
three who had fired, stopped to reload, while Will Revel
and Dan Hicks kept on.</p>

<p>To strike a man running at full speed through a densely-wooded forest, bounding aside and deviating on the course
every moment, is no easy task, and this the rangers well
knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“Keep y’ur shot, Dan!” cried Will Revel to the one running
at his side. “Thar’ll be a better chance to strike ’im
soon.”</p>

<p>The other comprehended him. Not sixty rods straight ahead
was a comparatively open space where the fugitive’s body
would be more exposed. Hulet would either have to cross
this or turn abruptly aside before reaching it. And the latter
alternative would give his pursuers a chance to gain upon him
rapidly.</p>

<p>Something more than a desire for revenge was now in the
minds of the pursuers, and, if possible, incited them to greater
speed. They remembered that Hulet’s escape would enhance
the dangers of old Rhodan and Goodbrand, and might also
result fatally to the noble Indian girl who had taken such
pains to seek them out and warn them.</p>

<p>Like hounds Will Revel and his comrade sprung on, keeping
their gaze upon the runaway, though not apparently gaining
a yard upon him. The latter did not seem to notice the
open space which he was rapidly approaching till he was
quite near it. Then, as if suddenly aware of his increased
danger, he whirled and struck toward the left.</p>

<p>“Now!” shouted Will Revel. “<em>You</em> try ’im, Dan, an’ I’ll
keep on.”</p>

<p>His plan was to reserve his own shot to the last, hoping
if Dan failed, to make it more effectual by taking advantage
of Hulet’s momentary confusion.</p>

<p>But the latter was neither hit nor diverted a moment by the
bullet of Dan Hicks, which must have whizzed very close to
his head. He was not more than twenty yards distant when
Revel jerked his rifle to a level and fired. Notwithstanding
the gloom which began rapidly to deepen, Revel saw that he
had struck the traitor near the shoulder, though Hulet still
ran on.</p>

<p>“Take ’eer o’ that!” shouted the exasperated ranger to his
friend, as he slung his rifle toward him. “By the great
Moses, that hellion shain’t give us all the slip!”</p>

<p>Without pausing for a second he drew a little ax from
his girdle and bounded on with maddened energy. He
knew the traitor would not long elude him. As if conscious
of this, Hulet also threw down his rifle and pealed out two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
or three ringing shouts of distress. Will Revel well knew
that the commotion might bring some of the lurking Indians
to the spot. But he also knew that his companions were
hurrying up. Conscious that he was gaining on the wretch,
he determined to bring him down at all hazards.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard some one bounding toward him and his
prey from an opposite direction. Not doubting that it was
an Indian, he drew back his arm to hurl the ax at Hulet, now
about a dozen yards away. But before he could throw the
weapon, he heard the twang of a bow, the whiz of an arrow,
and noticed that Hulet was struck in the arm. As quick as
thought the ax sped from his hand. But, as though some
evil genius protected Hulet, he suddenly sprung aside and the
ax missed him.</p>

<p>“Hold—what’s this?” cried a voice, suddenly.</p>

<p>“It’s a traitor—Sime Hulet—head him off, Mace, quick!”
shouted Will, who had recognized the speaker.</p>

<p>The next moment there was a series of shouts and bounds,
and Will saw the traitor fall to the earth before the sweep of
Mace’s rifle. Then the cry of a night-hawk, distinct and
clear, rung through the forest.</p>

<p>“Back, all on ye, back!” said Mace, as he met Revel and
saw his companions rushing up. “Thar’s nigh twenty uv the
cussed p’isons, an’ half on ’em ar’ comin’ this way. Back,
an’ get a better spot to meet ’em in!”</p>

<p>As he spoke they all heard the bounds of the Indians close
by. Aside from this, Revel remembered the signal of Moorooine.
The spot they were in was quite open, being the upper
part of the cleared space which Hulet had sought to avoid.
The gloom here was not yet so deep but that their forms
would be well outlined, and present fair marks to the Indians
hurrying up. Without loss of time the rangers darted back
and obtained cover.</p>

<p>Every weapon was soon reloaded. Fully alive to the occasion,
the men stationed themselves a little distance apart and
listened for their foes. Not a word was spoken, and even
their very breaths were hushed.</p>

<p>Ten minutes thus passed. It was equally still beyond the
open space. But suddenly a movement was heard a few rods
away, and the gaze of the men was strained toward the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
whence it appeared to come. The fast-approaching darkness
however, began to render objects on the open space very indistinct.</p>

<p>Will Revel glided noiselessly to the side of Mace.</p>

<p>“Take ’eer!” cautioned the latter. “We’re in a hornet’s
nest jes’ now. How’d ye find out ’bout thet cussed Hulet?”</p>

<p>Will rapidly explained.</p>

<p>“Hah! Then ’twar the Injun gal thet jest gave the
signal!”</p>

<p>“She was goin’ to find you,” said Will. “But I s’pose
she wanted to make sure that hellion was out o’ the way
fust.”</p>

<p>“Nat’ral enough. He’d bring her into diffikilty, of course.
But she k’n rest easy consarnin’ him. Blast ’im, I wish we
could ’a’ got ’im inter our paws alive.”</p>

<p>“Where were you, Mace?”</p>

<p>“Look out! Hark! Thar—it’s all still ag’in. Durn ’em,
they ain’t ’n no hurry to move. Whar was I? Up nigh the
Miami village when they gi’n me chase. It happened well,
for I not only got away, but seen a scrimmage on the lake—or
heerd it.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Scarred Eagle an’ Goodbrand war chased from the neck.
They hed a rig’lar devil’s tussle with some Injuns thet follered
’em in a canoe. I warned ’em off, but it cost me a
world of dodgin’. Ha, now thar’s a move yender, fur sartin!”</p>

<p>Their whispers instantly ceased, and they listened intently.
Any one unused to such scenes would not have believed a
leaf had stirred.</p>

<p>But these men had no doubt that a number of their foes
were moving so as to get in their rear. Revel saw Mace suddenly
elevate his rifle, and then lower it with a muttered
curse. At the same time a crackling noise came from the opposite
side of the opening.</p>

<p>“We must sarcumvent ’em in that game,” said Mace.</p>

<p>“How? fall back?”</p>

<p>“No—go forrard. No doubt half a dozen on ’em’s gone
down the ground, an’ no knowin’ how many ar’ d’rectly oppersite.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>We must pass ter the left o’ these, an’ go on towarts
the lake-shore. Ef Rhodan hez got landed, he an’ Goodbrand
’ll need help. We must try ter git ’em with us.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Shall I speak to the others?”</p>

<p>“Yis. No—hold on. I’ll dew that myself, an’ you go
on—one on ’em’s above ye now. I’ll try ter cross here,
shortly. You kin try the same furder up.”</p>

<p>“You’ll git into greater danger by that,” said Revel. “Them
that ar’ watchin’ from where it’s darker ’ll see ye the better.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so much resk as ter lay still here when a number
o’ the skunks are creepin’ up ahind us. Ef they come up in
time we’ll be atween tew fires, an’ then thar wouldn’t be half
a chance left. Move on.”</p>

<p>Convinced that his companion was right, Revel obeyed.
The darkness was now so great that he could see scarce half
a rifle’s length around him. A few yards away he found another
of the rangers, and hurriedly apprising him of Mace’s
plans, the two stole forward.</p>

<p>All the senses of the men were now literally strained. Not
only had they to avoid making any noise which might disclose
their position to lurking foes, but also to hold themselves ready
for any sudden encounter. At any moment they might meet
an enemy as agile, watchful and skilled in forest warfare as
themselves. And yet, instead of a feeling of dread, one of
wild, intense excitement thrilled their veins.</p>

<p>They had crept forward but a rod or two when they detected
similar movements on their right. Will Revel knew that the
Indians were moving up to intercept them, and that Mace was
perhaps at that moment gliding across the open space.</p>

<p>He whispered a moment to his companion. The latter
agreed to move on alone. Revel himself wished to strike
across the open space at this point.</p>

<p>He waited some moments, listening to the almost noiseless
advance of his fellow-rangers. Then he turned and was about
to glide across the open space, when a voice spoke close to his
ear. He knew it, and turned to see the Indian girl close beside
him.</p>

<p>“Where go now?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Over yonder,” replied Revel. “Some of the warriors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>have gone below here, an’ll soon be up ahind us.”</p>

<p>“Be much careful,” she admonished. “More warriors
comin’ from lake.”</p>

<p>“Ar’ ye sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes—sure. Has Evil Eye any news?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Will. “Seek Rhodan and Goodbrand. If
we live, the White Fox shall be found.”</p>

<p>At that instant a bright sheet of flame came from the opposite
side of the space, and the report of a rifle followed.
But before its echoes had ceased, a rifle just below them answered,
and an Indian’s death-groan was distinctly heard.</p>

<p>The Indian girl disappeared from Revel’s side as noiseless as
a shadow. Holding his rifle ready, he bent forward on foot
and knee, his gaze toward the spot where the Indian had
fallen. He knew it was Mace who had shot the warrior, and
he resolved to wait till the former should move.</p>

<p>The forest was now as still as though no living being lurked
in its depths. But presently he heard evidence that told him
his companions below were coming toward him.</p>

<p>He rose cautiously, and began to move on. He believed
Mace had changed his plan. Perhaps some of their foes were
already gliding directly up on their rear. Suddenly he paused.
Some of the rest were very near him.</p>

<p>“Mace?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“He’s behind,” whispered a voice belonging to another of
the rangers. “Four or five ar’ but a leetle ways ahind us.”</p>

<p>“There’s more ahead than we thought, tew. But there’s
no chance to tell the rest, and too late to go back. Come
on!”</p>

<p>At this moment a sudden commotion began in the bushes
not ten yards away. Not a cry was heard. The combatants
were too intent on the struggle.</p>

<p>The two rangers leaped forward. In a second they could
discern two dark figures clinched and struggling for the mastery.
Before they themselves could interpose, a groan burst
out, and one of the combatants dropped.</p>

<p>“Thar—durn yer!” muttered the voice of the triumphant
ranger; but even as the unguarded words came from his lips,
a hatchet in the hands of an Indian behind crashed through
his brain, and he fell against Revel.</p>

<p>The latter nearly fell himself, but recovering, was in time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
to ward off a knife-blow, and to close with a powerful savage.
As he did so, two rifle-reports rung out near by, and he heard
bold, bounding steps across the open space to his right.</p>

<p>He noted these circumstances, even at that fearful moment;
and then he was struggling fiercely with his enemy.</p>

<p>The savage had him at a disadvantage; but Revel happened,
at the outset, to grasp the Indian’s long hair, and pulled
his head back. With his left hand he grasped him around
the waist, and tried to throw him. The Indian’s left hand
was nearly useless, but his right held a knife, which began to
make havoc upon Revel’s shoulder, despite the latter’s endeavor
to hold the Indian’s arm.</p>

<p>Suddenly the struggle brought Revel’s adversary against a
prostrate tree-trunk over which he fell, dragging the ranger
upon him. The accident enabled Will to draw his own knife,
and the next instant it was buried in the Indian’s breast!</p>

<p>Springing up, he saw that the ranger who had followed him
had been similarly engaged. The latter was underneath a
savage, and struggling desperately to avoid the knife-thrusts
aimed at his breast. Revel sprung to his assistance. But a
dark form was before him—that of Mace. The latter dealt
the Indian a blow, and with a groan he rolled aside.</p>

<p>“Down, quick!” said Mace; and with the words, he dropped
to the ground, jerking Will down beside him. Two or three
reports rung out, and the bullets whistled over them. The
three men hastily crept a few yards aside.</p>

<p>“Where’s the rest?” whispered Will.</p>

<p>“A little below us, workin’ their way up,” said Mace.
“They’ll git tired o’ this, cuss ’em.”</p>

<p>“Poor Hank!” said Dan Hicks. “That makes two.”</p>

<p>“They’re gittin’ paid!” said Mace, grimly. “Hish!”</p>

<p>Footsteps were distinguished coming from below. Mace
was satisfied whose they were. In the course of three minutes,
the other rangers came up. Meantime, nothing to indicate
any new position of the Indians had been heard.</p>

<p>A hurried consultation was held by the men. Mace knew
that not less than a dozen savages were around them yet.
But the commotion had diverted those on the watch for Rhodan;
so it was naturally supposed the latter and his Indian
friend had succeeded in landing, and were perhaps, not far off.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Yet to venture on signal-notes would apprise the savages of
their exact position.</p>

<p>“Let each one hold his knife ready,” said Mace. “We’ll
separate a little an’ keep on this course. It’s no wuss’n to stay
here till they steal upon us. Mebbe we’ll run across Rhodan.
Come.”</p>

<span class="p75">THE HUMAN BIRD.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> course the rangers had conversed in whispers, which
could not have been heard three yards away. And not for a
second had they ceased to watch and listen with strained
senses.</p>

<p>But they did not start. Another rifle spoke from the opposite
side of the open space, the bullet passing near them.
And during the succeeding moment or two, they detected
movements at their left. For a short time longer they remained
motionless and silent.</p>

<p>“These on our left ar’ goin’ up,” said Mace. “Ten to one
most o’ the skunks ar’ above us now. I’m goin’ ter make
stret across the openin’.”</p>

<p>Joe Hill undertook to whisper something; but the other
had no time to hear him, being already creeping after Mace.
Joe suppressed a wrathy exclamation and followed.</p>

<p>The nature of the ground was such that a practiced scout
could steal over it without much danger of being heard. The
greatest danger was being seen. Each went on hand and
knee, moving slowly. They were nearly across, when Mace
suddenly stopped and hugged close to the ground. Those
behind followed suit.</p>

<p>They were not more than ten yards from the edge of the
woods beyond, which was marked by deeper darkness. What
had Mace discovered?</p>

<p>It was a silent query soon answered. A figure was moving
forward, intent on crossing to the side they had just left.
Evidently the author of the last shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>The Indian came on slowly. He was not over-cautious, for
his body was but half bent. Its dim outlines barely perceptible
through the deep gloom, seemed twice the natural size. He
probably had not, as yet, the faintest suspicion that enemies
were so near him.</p>

<p>He was nearly past the motionless rangers, when suddenly
he stopped. Was it instinct or his keen vision-sense that
caused him to glance around?</p>

<p>Not the latter, evidently, for soon he moved on.</p>

<p>He had taken no more than three steps, when he again
stopped and peered aside. He was now but little more than
a yard from the side of Joe Hill. He gazed around for a
moment, and then bent lower down. He meant to know if
the almost imperceptible stir made by Joe Hill was only
fancy.</p>

<p>The Indian was speedily undeceived. Two long arms
suddenly shot up, clasping his neck and throat like a vice.
No power to cry out; nor to struggle. Two forms rose
quickly, near Joe, and prevented this. The knife of one was
sent to the Indian’s heart. Half a minute later, Hill released
his grasp, and was creeping forward after his companions.</p>

<p>They were shortly within the edge of the woods. At that
moment three rifles spoke opposite the open space and above
them. As though frightened by the commotion, two distinct
cries of a night-hawk followed close upon the echoes of the
reports.</p>

<p>“I was right!” whispered Mace. “That volley tells it.
They don’t suspect we’ve crossed the openin’. Come on!”</p>

<p>“No—here; not that way,” said Revel. “Furder south,
in the direction of the night-hawk’s notes. They were made
by the Injun girl, an’ mean, come. We’ll find it safer in
that direction!”</p>

<p>And the prediction proved true. As the rangers crept in
the direction indicated, their practiced ears heard stealthy footsteps
a few rods away, approaching the open space they had
just left.</p>

<p>Acting on the supposition that the way was clear before
them, they ventured on more haste. Twenty minutes passed,
and they were far from the scene of their late struggle. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>all the while Will Revel was looking for some sign of Moorooine’s
presence. The section of forest they were now in was
not very dense, and the stars overhead afforded a faint light
around them.</p>

<p>“We’re less ’n a mile from the lake,” said Mace, halting.
“Scarred Eagle must ’a’ heerd the shots, an’ orter be clus by
ef he landed anywhar opposite us. I’ll venture on a signal,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>But another signal was given before him—that of the Indian
girl, meaning “beware!” She was evidently at some
point between them and the opening they had left. Were
the Indians following them toward the lake?</p>

<p>A few moments of strict silence convinced them of this.
Savages at the right, left, and not a hundred yards behind
them.</p>

<p>Their predicament was hardly less dangerous than half an
hour previous. They were further from their foes, but the
latter had them within an arc, with the lake-shore for a base.</p>

<p>To get out of this was the point. They began a hurried
consultation; but it was quickly brought to an end. Behind
them, and on either flank the Indians were approaching rapidly.
That the latter were aware of their position, was evident from
their bold movements.</p>

<p>The rangers glided directly forward, from tree to tree.
Presently the ball was opened by the discharge of several
rifles behind them. A bullet grazed the arm of Ben Mace,
the others were untouched. Then came a chorus of fierce,
loud yells, enough to curdle the blood; but not of these men,
who were now on a full run.</p>

<p>They knew ten minutes would bring them into the denser
portion of forest, skirting the lake. Once there, a better chance
would open for concealing themselves or stealing past their
enemies.</p>

<p>“Spread out!” said Mace. “Thar’ll be less chance o’ bein’
hit.”</p>

<p>“Let us turn on dthe domd apes,” cried Tim Devine, as
a bullet grazed his shoulder. “Dthey be on us in a minnit.”</p>

<p>“No; r-r-r-r-<em>run</em>, durn ye!” blurted Hill.</p>

<p>A peculiar whistle at this moment rung out at quite a distance
ahead. All knew it was that of Scarred Eagle, and
pressed on for life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Three minutes later.</p>

<p>“I—say—Mace, what d’ye think of—”</p>

<p>“Yis; down for a second and turn on ’em. Don’t waste
lead!”</p>

<p>A number of Indians converging from the right were
hardly thirty yards distant. Three or four of them had just
fired, and a hasty glance behind showed them coming on in
something of a cluster.</p>

<p>The pursued rangers suddenly stopped, dropped on foot and
knee, and poured a volley into their pursuers. Then, amidst
the echoes of yells and groans, they sprung onward again, like
lightning. But the check they had given in one quarter was
more than balanced by loss of time and the proximity of their
enemies coming directly behind.</p>

<p>“Every man for himself, an’ devil take the hindmost!”
The action of the borderers was in keeping with this old saying,
at least. Knife in one hand, rifle in the other, they sped
on, intent on penetrating the deeper lines of darkness
ahead.</p>

<p>The Indians were fearfully near. The foremost were hardly
thirty feet behind when a hatchet whizzed, striking Tim’s rifle
and whirling him half round. He was barely in time to recover
his balance and club his rifle.</p>

<p>“Take dthat! Och, here’s for betthur nor worse, thin!”</p>

<p>He had laid one of his assailants low, and the next instant
was grasped by another. By great good-fortune he knifed
this one, who in convulsive agony bore him to the ground. At
the moment two rifles rung out and two savages fell headlong,
rolling over both.</p>

<p>With desperate quickness, the Irishman sprung up in time
to see one or two men vanish before him. He sprung after
them, not certain whether they were friends or foes.</p>

<p>The matter was soon determined. A dozen bounds brought
him to a natural barricade of prostrate tree-trunks, over which
he tumbled in his excitement, his heels coming in contact with
the head and shoulders of a man.</p>

<p>“Gi-gi-git—oh, cuss ye!” muttered Hill.</p>

<p>“Hish!” said a voice. “Crunch down hyur all on ye, an’
not stir onless—”</p>

<p>The voice was that of Scarred Eagle. He had not a chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
to finish the sentence, for a dark body of savages were rushing
on, not ten yards away. He himself dashed away with
Goodbrand, leaving the men crouched under the fallen timber.</p>

<p>Every one of them understood Scarred Eagle’s object. His
plan was the bold one of trying to draw the entire <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse</i> of
Indians past them, running the risk of escaping himself afterward.
And, indeed, the bounds of himself and Goodbrand,
as they sped away, were enough to convince the pursuers that
all their victims were yet running. But to make the deception
more perfect, a loud, excited voice cried:</p>

<p>“Now—to the lake-shore for y’ur lives!”</p>

<p>The next moment a number of savages rushed past, on
either side of the concealed men, and four or five sprung directly
over them. One of these, unfortunately for himself,
slipped and fell beside them. But the incident was unheeded
by his companions, and before they were a dozen bounds
away, the hand of Ben Mace stilled the savage forever.</p>

<p>Then every man reloaded as quickly as it was possible to
do in the gloom.</p>

<p>“What d’ye think, Mace?” whispered Revel.</p>

<p>“We might ’s well skim back an’ git ter the bivouac ef
we kin. The woods ’pears ter be full on ’em, cuss ’em!”</p>

<p>“Just what I think. Less you an’ me an’ Dan, try to find
poor Hank an’ the rest, an’ make stret back.”</p>

<p>“An’ laive Scarred Aigle is it?” said Tim. “Divil blow
yees, pwhat wan of ye—”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>shet</em> up!” ejaculated Hill. “Him an’ Goodbrand ’ll
uther dodge ’em or take th-th-the <em>boat</em>; blast ye, come on!”</p>

<p>They moved quickly and stealthily back on the course.
There was no danger of their being heard, for the commotion
made by the outwitted savages came every moment to their
ears.</p>

<p>But they had not proceeded very far when the noise and
commotion ceased. Mace paused and glanced back anxiously.</p>

<p>“Mebbe the murderin’ skunks begin ter suspict what’s happined,”
he said. “Must be Rhodan an’ Goodbrand ’ll uther
git back this way, ur take to thar canoe. But ef I thought—”</p>

<p>He suddenly ceased speaking and listened intently. A
thrill war-whoop echoed through the woods in the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of the baffled Indians. It was succeeded by a chorus of fierce
shouts.</p>

<p>“One or both on’ ’em’s took!” exclaimed Mace, excitedly.
“’Twas the price fur snatchin’ us frum death, an’ I fur one
’ll go back ag’in’ all odds!”</p>

<p>“Good, me hairty!” exclaimed the impulsive Irishman.
“Tim Devine ’ud foller yees ef ’twas to dthe mouth of purgatory
itself. Thrue as me father was a docthur!”</p>

<p>Ere the generous Celt had concluded, all of them had
started. Each knew it might be his last tramp on earth.
But not one of them would have hesitated even before more
certain perils. And they hoped that Scarred Eagle might yet
escape.</p>

<p>As they were hurrying on, a dark figure appeared suddenly
before them.</p>

<p>“No go yit—wait,” said a low voice.</p>

<p>It was the Indian girl, Moorooine. And as she spoke the
rangers were around her.</p>

<p>“What!” said Revel. “Do you know what has happened?”</p>

<p>“She kain’t do no good—come on,” exclaimed Mace. “We
orter know what that war-whoop meant.”</p>

<p>“’Twas Miami whoop—but friendly one,” persisted the
girl. “Warkechin. Know him. Called Goodbrand.”</p>

<p>Mace paused. “How d’ye know?” he said. “An’ yit—”</p>

<p>“I b’lieve it!” said Hicks and Revel, in a breath. “Ye
know it mout be, Ben,” continued the latter. “The Miami
is workin’ for Rhodan’s safety an’ his own.”</p>

<p>“Yes; tryin’ save <em>both</em>,” said Moorooine. “Now you
know <em>that</em>—go on, help.”</p>

<p>She herself led the way, keeping in view before them for
a few seconds, and then disappearing altogether. She seemed
to move as noiseless as a bird.</p>

<p>Again every thing around was silent as a charnel-house.
The rangers, scattered quite a distance apart, soon halted at
a signal from Mace, and came together.</p>

<p>“Two kin go ahead an’ reconnoiter,” he said. “You an’
me, Revel. Ef Scarred Eagle is atween us an’ the Injuns
he’ll show himself soon. Ef ’e don’t, we’ll—huh! Thet Injun
girl ag’in, I reckon.”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, Moorooine, who had turned back to meet them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Both comin’—sure!” she said, hurriedly. “Moorooine’s
ears have been open. She heard warriors talk. White Fox
is prisoner at village. Evil Eye know where. Mus’ go there
now, ’fore warriors suspect me. I will try for save White
Fox till his brothers come to help me.”</p>

<p>Loud, fierce yells suddenly resounded through the dim
aisles of the woods, from the direction of the lake. At the
same moment the bounds of two men were heard close by.</p>

<p>“Friends most here,” added the girl. And as she dashed
away, Scarred Eagle and Goodbrand sprung forward into
their midst.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter nobreak">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="p75">THE GORGE DECOY.</span></h2></div>


<p>“<span class="smcap">On</span> to the gorge!” exclaimed Scarred Eagle, hurriedly.
And forthwith, all were gliding back in that direction.</p>

<p>A few minutes brought them into the denser section of
woods beside the opening. Here they halted and listened,
but heard as yet no sound of pursuit.</p>

<p>Mace hurriedly explained what had taken place, together
with the fact revealed by the Indian girl, that Brom was a
prisoner.</p>

<p>“What!” said Scarred Eagle, hoarsely. “The boy took?”
The revelation of Hulet’s treachery and death was as nothing
to this.</p>

<p>“Thar’s no doubt on’t, Rhodan,” replied Mace. “He
dud ’is arrant at the fort an’ got nabbed in the neighborhood
of the village on his way back.”</p>

<p>At this moment, Goodbrand, who had remained in the
rear, glided up.</p>

<p>“Bes’ go!” he whispered. “Comin’ ag’in, an’ more from
village, guess!”</p>

<p>“You that <em>kin</em>, find the body of poor Hank an’ hide it
from their devilish ways!” said Scarred Eagle.</p>

<p>This was soon done. The friendly Miami kept somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
in the rear of the rest, who pressed cautiously on toward
the gorge.</p>

<p>For some time not even a whisper was uttered. A terrible
anxiety filled the heart of Scarred Eagle. All knew the
cause was Brom Vail. But they knew a present attempt to
reach the village and endeavor to release the latter, would
be worse than useless. It would be an extremely dangerous
undertaking under far more favorable circumstances. But
one thought gave a ray of hope, and that was what the Indian
girl had promised. But would she alone be able to
effect Brom’s release?</p>

<p>They were nearing the retreat when Scarred Eagle suddenly
halted and listened anxiously.</p>

<p>“Goodbrand orter j’ined us by this time,” he said. “But
thar’s one thing, men. Whatever news he may bring of
the mad devils, we must git close to their camp afore mornin’
ef the boy’s tu be saved. Mebbe he kain’t be. It’ll be an
oncommon job to undertake, an’ I ask no man tu go that
ain’t parfictly willin’.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t a fair way o’ puttin’ it!” said Mace. “Ye’d orter
know thar ain’t a man of us thet won’t stan’ by ye an’ <em>him</em>
till the last!” This resolve was echoed by the rest.</p>

<p>“I knowed it, men, I knowed it!” said Scarred Eagle, hopefully.
“Our mission as scouts is done, mostly. The major
at the fort’s got his cue, an’ thar’s nothin’ but to wait till
Bradstreet comes up, when a sally kin be made. Ay, here’s
Goodbrand!”</p>

<p>The latter glided up with the news that quite a reinforcement
had arrived from the direction of the Indian village.
Some of these were seeking out their dead warriors; others
were lurking in the woods near the scene of conflict.</p>

<p>“No danger come here afore light,” added Goodbrand.
“They keep big watch an’ look for trail in mornin’!”</p>

<p>“Afore then, we’ll make indivors to help a boy that’s never
flinched a duty on account of danger,” said Rhodan. “We’ll
git to the gorge fust, an’ consider our plans.”</p>

<p>The mouth of this was soon reached. They stole cautiously
up to the bivouac, guided only by sense of touch and
a previous knowledge of the place. The darkness of midnight
reigned. Goodbrand remained a short distance away, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
sentinel. The rest sought for the victim of Hulet’s treachery;
but for some time the search was vain. At last it was found
and brought into a recess in the cliff where a torch had been
lit. Exclamations of horror burst from the rangers as the
light shone upon the body. It told a fearful story better than
words could have done.</p>

<p>The victim had been mangled about the head, breast and
arms by some wild beast—a panther, probably. It was well
known this animal never preys upon a <em>dead body</em>! The inference
was horrible! The animal must have hovered near,
and, attracted by the smell of blood, attacked the unfortunate
man while the latter was dying. His rifle was found discharged,
and he had evidently made one desperate effort to
keep the monster at bay!</p>

<p>The men looked at each other with faces blanched.</p>

<p>“The curse of every honest man light on the head of the
wretch that caused this!” said Scarred Eagle, breathing hard.
“But—ay, the wretch has gone to his account, an’ ’ll be judged
accordin’ to his deeds. Take the body out, men, an’ place it
where it’ll never be distarbed.”</p>

<p>They obeyed, with sad and gloomy feelings. The body
was placed in one of the nooks with which the sides of the
cliff abounded. This being securely closed, the midnight burial
was over.</p>

<p>The rangers stood consulting with their leader, when suddenly
Goodbrand came in.</p>

<p>“They comin’—<em>find</em>!” he said, excitedly. “We bes’ go
quick, ’fore surround!”</p>

<p>They immediately glided out and passed down to the mouth
of the gorge. Then, turning to the right, they struck into a
narrow by-path leading to the rear of the high cliffs.</p>

<p>“Now, Goodbrand,” said Scarred Eagle, pausing, “tell us
the lay o’ the denger that we may use our wits to the purpus.”</p>

<p>“This right way!” was the other’s whispered reply. “They
comin’ from way we came. Very slow come, so’s take sure.”</p>

<p>“Hish!” interrupted Scarred Eagle. “<em>We’re surrounded
now!</em> Drop close, every man, an’ not stir for your
lives!”</p>

<p>As he gave this order, he glided from their midst directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
back toward the gorge. Perhaps not more than two of the
men imagined his object. But not one of them moved or
even whispered.</p>

<p>Hardly a minute passed before he was again beside them.
Meantime they had heard abundant evidence that the gorge
retreat was indeed surrounded, though not closely.</p>

<p>“The bloody-minded whelps ar’ drawin’ the circle closer,”
said Scarred Eagle. “They’ll see a torch prisently, which
I’ve took good care to fix in the rocks. It’s a great p’int that
they think they ain’t suspected here. The light’ll burn out
afore half an hour. When it does, they’ll think it’s snatched
away by our hands. They won’t dare to enter the gorge afore
light, thinkin’ their enemy is prepared. But they’ll watch
about here till then. Ef we k’n git clear ’ithout a tussle, our
chance at the village ’ll be all that a reasonable man orter expect.
Ye see how much depends.”</p>

<p>A moment later the men were stealing forward, each one
by himself. Not a dry leaf rustled under a hand or knee;
not a bush was caused to vibrate; even their breaths were
drawn slowly as their bodies were. The least accident would
prove fatal, and all realized it.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes passed, as time is counted; but, to each of
the men, it seemed an hour. Then they found themselves
together near a brook whose waters caught the glimmer of
the starlight. And as yet they had not moved more than
fifty yards. At this moment several Indian signals were heard.
As by magic the rangers, who had partly risen, sunk to the
ground.</p>

<p>It was well they did so in time. Between them and the
space along the banks of the brook, several figures glided by
and disappeared in the gloom above. One passed so near, they
might have touched him.</p>

<p>They did not venture to move again for several minutes.
Scarred Eagle was the first to set the example—all following
him silently. They had gone but a short distance further
when a chorus of triumphant signal-shouts came from the
vicinity of the gorge.</p>

<p>“That tells it,” said Scarred Eagle, pausing. “The skunks
think they’ve got us caged, an’ now we must work fast. Ar’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>ye sure ye killed the tretor, Mace?”</p>

<p>The sudden question made the men glance into each other’s
faces in surprise.</p>

<p>“The blow I gin ’im orter done it,” answered Mace, with
a savage imprecation. “I didn’t hev any time ter look
close.”</p>

<p>“I’m ’fear’d ye didn’t,” said the veteran scout. “Least
wise, he must ’a’ lived long enough ter told some on ’em whar
our bivouac was. But, thar’s no time ter talk of that, <em>now</em>.
We must siperate. ’Tain’t more’n half a mile to the p’int of
shore where the canoe’s hid. You, Goodbrand, take Hill and
Revel with ye, an’ bring the canoe ter the place ye know of
nigh the village. Me an’ Mace’ll go stret through an’ git thar
long enough afore ye to see what’s to be done. Hicks an’
Tim’ll stay behind an—”</p>

<p>“Divil a fut behint!” interrupted the Irishman, stoutly.
“No, be gobs! Phat’ll I stay behint for? I’ll take me share
in the worst as well as the best, so!”</p>

<p>“Ef by the wust ye mean <em>denger</em>, ye’ll find enough o’ that,
both on ye,” said Scarred Eagle. “This hyur neighboorhood
’ll be thoroughly s’arched by mornin’. Ef, in the course of two
hours after the rest are gone, you an’ Hicks sh’u’d be convinced
these devils war goin’ <em>back</em> toward the village, it’ll be y’ur part
ter draw ’em back, so’s to give us a better chance to work for
the boy.”</p>

<p>“A chance, is it? Pwhat c’u’d the two of us alone
do?”</p>

<p>“I needn’t say thar’s no time to lose, Tim,” said the other,
“an’ I trust ye won’t hender us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll <em>sthay</em>,” said Tim, spitefully. “Ownly—look now:
suppose yees all git in dthe lurch! S’posin’ yees all fail!
<em>Dthat’s</em> it—how are we to know?”</p>

<p>“By comin’ to a place that I’ve told Hicks of,” said Scarred
Eagle. “We’ll have the boy out o’ thar clutches afore three
hours, I hope. Keep a sharp look-out about here. Ef ye
should ondertake to draw ’em after ye, take good care ye
don’t git nabbed y’urselves. You’ll find y’ur task dengerous
enough.”</p>

<p>Goodbrand and his two companions glided away in the
gloom toward the point of shore where lay the hidden canoe.
Scarred Eagle and Mace stood a few moments listening, till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
sure that Hicks and the Irishman were well off toward a spot
where they had been directed to take a position to wait and
watch. Then they themselves started on their perilous mission
to the Indian village.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter nobreak">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="p75">BEAUTY IN BONDS.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Indian village was about six miles distant, and stood
on a high bluff overlooking the Detroit river. A jut from
the rocky bluff extended some fifty feet into the stream at this
point. At the angle thus formed was a gloomy subterranean
passage, through which the water flowed with a sullen roar.
Far within, the channel made an abrupt turn, gliding past a
recess in the rocks large enough to contain a dozen men.
Thence was a devious, rough passage communicating with
the shore.</p>

<p>This was Goodbrand’s destination with the canoe and men.
Once within, they could watch the village, and be able to
penetrate to its very center at short notice.</p>

<p>The Indians did not know of this subterranean chamber,
and of the subterranean passage they held a tradition that it
was the abode of an evil spirit, and never entered it. This
fact was well known to several rangers who had explored the
passage, and now its existence seemed most favorable to their
undertaking.</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle and Mace pressed forward as fast as possible.
They hoped to reach the village and by some stratagem release
Brom Vail before daylight. The chance seemed favorable.
Many of the warriors were absent at the siege of the
fort, and of those not so employed, they had reason to believe
a good portion were at that moment hovering about the
gorge.</p>

<p>The two men were more than two-thirds of the distance
to the Indian village, when suddenly Scarred Eagle, who was
in advance, put back his hand and came to a dead halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>“What is it?” whispered Ben Mace.</p>

<p>The other did not answer at once. With his body bent
forward he was listening intently; and now, through the
gloomy, solemn aisles, Mace detects sounds telling that lurkers
are ahead.</p>

<p>“Kin it be thet some o’ the reds have come in another direction
from the gorge? If so—”</p>

<p>“No, Mace, ’tain’t it. I don’t b’lieve I’m deceived in
thinkin’ these ahead is them that ar’ takin’ the dead an’ wounded
to the village. They hev ter move slow, an’ that’s why
we’ve overtook ’em.”</p>

<p>“What’s ter be done? Ef we wait ter foller ’em—”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by Rhodan’s grasping his arm, and for
a moment or two they almost held their breaths. Both entertained
the same suspicions now, and were waiting to see
if these would be verified.</p>

<p>They did not remain long in doubt. The fact that the
party ahead had begun to move on again, making considerable
noise, did not deceive the scouts. They were almost
sure some of the party had turned back, evidently suspicious
of being followed.</p>

<p>It was easy for the rangers to evade these. But they wished
to do more. The evident suspicion in the mind of the Indians,
that a white foe had been secretly dogging their steps,
must be dispelled; otherwise an attempt to enter the village
unperceived, would be worse than useless.</p>

<p>“They’ve heerd sunthin’ thet makes ’em suspicious,” said
Scarred Eagle. “They must go on, satisfied ’twas a panther
on thar tracks scentin’ the blood of the wounded warriors.
Come in here, where the darkness is thicker.”</p>

<p>They moved to the left, keeping a yard or two apart, and
taking steps which might indeed be mistaken for those of
the animal named. Under a dense foliage they halted, and
then a purring sound broke out through the stillness. As the
slight echoes ceased, an almost imperceptible stir was heard
not far ahead; but this as suddenly ceased, and all became
silent again. It was evident the fellow had not entirely taken
the bait.</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle and Mace now dropped upon all-fours and
stole forward, imitating the stealthy advance of a panther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly the silence was again broken by a cry that caused
startling echoes around. These had scarcely died away when
the sound of feet was heard retreating rapidly toward the Indian
camp. The ruse had succeeded.</p>

<p>“What now, Rhodan?” said Mace, as they rose.</p>

<p>“Foller ’em up,” was the brief reply.</p>

<p>“We mout flank past ’em.”</p>

<p>“’Twould be no use. We’d lose as much as we’d gain.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t an hour to daylight now.”</p>

<p>“I know; but ’twon’t do to resk diskivery yit!” said
Scarred Eagle, with a tremor in his voice. “We must fust
git into camp, an’ try to find where Brom, ef he’s alive, is
confined. Then—’ll come the resk.”</p>

<p>“Goodbrand an’ the rest must be at the jut afore this.”</p>

<p>“They won’t move ’ithout a good reason till they hear
something of us. Not till the last minnit must we signal an
attack—not till t’other plan fails.”</p>

<p>The two were stealing forward again, keeping as near to
the retreating Indians as possible without danger of discovery.</p>

<p>“Thar’ll be a powwow when these ’uns git in with thar
burdens,” said Mace. “It’ll rouse the hull nest.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be the more in our favor,” said the other. “We
must keep a sharp watch for the Indian girl.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes they noticed that it began to be lighter
ahead, and they were very near the open bluff on which stood
the village. Pushing forward, they soon saw the Indians before
them, as the latter emerged upon the bluff. As these disappeared,
the trailers pressed on; the more hastily, as a sound
began to break on their ears, denoting some unusual commotion
in the village.</p>

<p>A moment or two later, and they were peering into the
camp. The inmates were not only astir, but seemed greatly
excited. It was not all caused by the approach of those
bearing the dead and wounded, for even as the scouts looked,
these last were discovered and greeted with howls of sorrow.</p>

<p>“What kin it mean, Scarred Eagle?”</p>

<p>“Let’s git nearer and see. Thar’s a good chance now.”</p>

<p>They began to glide forward, on hand and knee, directing
their course so as to gain the rear of a row of rude huts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Meantime, the excitement among the warriors seemed to increase,
and yells, fierce and angry, were mingled with the cries
of grief. The two men were about twenty yards from the
edge of the woods, when they raised partly up beside a stump,
and obtained a better view of the excited throng. To their
surprise, they saw that not less than fifty warriors were present,
nearly a score of whom were clustered upon the bank
of the river, just above the angle formed by the jut.</p>

<p>“Thar!” exclaimed Mace. “The story’s told. Thar’s
more o’ the hellions here than we thought, an’ the wust on’t
is they’ve suspicted Goodbrand’s party, an’ ar’ watchin’ the
rocks!”</p>

<p>“I see!” said Scarred Eagle, uneasily. “It’s an unfortunit
thing for all. But, I’ll try ter find the boy if my life pays
for the attempt. Seems ter me the Injun gal—ha, look there!
It’s <em>her</em>, as I live!”</p>

<p>A number of the Indians were hurrying a captive, who
had been in their midst, toward one of the huts. The glow
of starlight over the open bluff enabled the lurking men to
identify the captive as Moorooine. They knew her by occasionally
hearing her name pronounced, coupled with angry
maledictions. She was bound hand and foot, and thrust
into one of the huts, as though she had been a brute.</p>

<p>“The brave gal’s been catched in tryin’ to do sunthin’ for
Brom,” said Rhodan. “<em>He’s</em> in one o’ the huts above, where
they’ve put her in, likely. I judge so, ’cos two o’ the imps
seem ter be watchin’ it close. No doubt the boy’s well tied;
but since his release hez been ondertook, they mean ter make
sure on ’im. Thar’s one apiece for us to work for, now, Ben
Mace, an’ no hope thet any o’ the rest ’ll git a chance ter help
us. Be ye ready?”</p>

<p>“Lead on!”</p>

<p>They again crept forward, and soon found themselves in
the rear of the line of huts. They could hear the tread of
feet, and the jabber of excited voices, all making a confusion
most favorable to their purpose. Not ten feet lay between
them and the hut into which had been thrust the Indian girl,
when an Indian was dimly seen, coming from the opposite
space toward them.</p>

<p>They lay as close to the ground as possible. The savage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
came on, and the concealed men saw that another followed.
Both halted so near, that they might not only have touched
the lurking whites, but have <em>seen</em> them by a chance look-down.
One lightning glance on the part of the scouts, revealed the
odious face of the wretch, Hulet!</p>

<p>“Now, speak,” said the Indian to the renegade. “What
has Sly Hate to say that he has not said?”</p>

<p>“This, Heavy Sleep,” replied the other, speaking so as to
be heard above the confusion around. “The waters are deep
where they pass under the rocks. The roar makes your
people afraid.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” muttered Heavy Sleep, shaking his head. “A bad
Manitou keeps council there. What mean?”</p>

<p>“I know a secret about the place, which I learnt from our
white enemies by stealth. I will tell you what it is, and then—ha,
what, ho!”</p>

<p>By accident the wretch cast his eye down, and noted a dark
crouching figure. The next moment it sprung up like lightning,
and a knife was buried to the hilt in Hulet’s breast!
Heavy Sleep, with a ringing yell, sprung upon Mace, who met
him with the same bloody weapon which had sent the renegade
to death. The Indian avoided the thrust, however; but
before he could seize his adversary, the hatchet of Scarred
Eagle crashed through his brain!</p>

<p>“Come!” cried Mace, hoarsely, and he had just turned to
flee, as a bevy of Indians burst through between the huts, who,
uttering their alarm-cries, sprung after him. In an instant
pursued and pursuers were off like the wind.</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle had hesitated a moment too long. Notwithstanding
the danger, he could not bring himself to flee. A
sudden wild hope, that the confusion might enable him to yet
rescue his boy, determined him. And just before the aroused
warriors darted from the front in pursuit of Mace, he threw
himself flat to the ground close beside the hut.</p>

<p>The excitement and alarm that now prevailed may be
imagined. Half a dozen times, in as many seconds, Scarred
Eagle was upon the point of springing up, as he imagined he
was discovered. Some of the reds, not in pursuit of Mace,
almost trod upon him, as they huddled around the bodies of
Heavy Sleep and Hulet. In a few moments the victims were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
carried around to the front, and, watching his opportunity
Scarred Eagle nestled more closely to the rear side of the
hut. Then, hastily making an aperture, he peered in, and
saw the captive Indian girl tightly bound and alone. Something
more than a desire to communicate with her caused
him to squeeze under the rude tent-cloth and enter. There
was a pile of skins in the nearest corner, under which he
might secrete himself, and he lost no time in doing so.</p>

<p>The rush of feet from the river convinced him how narrow
had been his escape thus far. The spot where the victims
had fallen was again crowded, amid a perfect tornado of
howls and imprecations. Seeing there were no warriors
about the door, he spoke to the Indian girl, who seemed unaware
of his presence. His voice reached her, and with a
painful effort she raised her head and recognized him.</p>

<p>“White Fox got away, but drown in river,” she said, faintly.
“Me no care for to live now! Hide down quick—some
comin’.”</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle crouched under the skins, keeping his weapons
ready. His quick mind had its own theory in regard to
Brom’s death. Some of the terribly-enraged warriors, evidently
well aware of some part taken by the girl in regard
to Brom, came forward, their eyes glaring like a hyena’s. But
at this moment three ringing rifle-reports came from the forest
causing them to rush out tumultuously.</p>

<div class="chapter nobreak">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="p75">THE HEART OF LOVE.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> understand Moorooine’s situation, it is necessary that
we briefly trace her movements after leaving the side of the
rangers in the forest.</p>

<p>She had experienced much difficulty in getting clear of the
circle of warriors without discovery. The latter had dispatched
two of their swiftest runners for reinforcements, and
these had begun to arrive. Knowing that a knowledge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
her presence would arouse suspicions, she had been obliged
to remain concealed a long time. And when, at last, she
made good her retreat toward the village, she little dreamed
that two persons who knew of her movements and intentions
had gone to intercept her.</p>

<p>One of these was the wretch Hulet. The blow of Mace
had stunned him only, and when the closely-pressed rangers
dashed back to cover, he managed to creep away, and soon
communicated with a warrior, and disclosed all he knew.
And half an hour later, the warrior was going with him toward
the village, after informing another where the bivouac
of the rangers was situated. But concerning Moorooine the
fellow kept silent.</p>

<p>The two reached the village but a short time before the
Indian girl. The latter found that a number of warriors had
come in from the siege of the fort, and that the whole camp
was in commotion over the news brought by the runners.</p>

<p>Knowing of the reinforcements sent to hunt down the
rangers, she felt that no aid would come from them. The task
of releasing Brom was to devolve upon her alone. She well
knew what the consequences of failure or even of <em>success</em>
might be. But she did not shrink.</p>

<p>It took her some time to find the bark lodge where Brom
was confined. The next thing was to ascertain if he were
alone, and if not, to devise some stratagem to get rid of his
guard.</p>

<p>To her joy she found that the prisoner was alone. To
make an opening in the rear of his prison-hut and creep inside,
was the work of a moment.</p>

<p>An idea of her extreme caution and skill may be formed
from the fact, that as yet the two plotters watching for her
appearance were not aware of her return.</p>

<p>No sooner had she entered the hut, than she closed the
aperture and crept toward White Fox, who was sitting upright.
He heard and suspected her. He had in fact hoped
to receive her aid, and had rightly supposed she was not ignorant
of his situation. The thought that she was near caused
the blood to course through his veins like wildfire. But
suddenly, a warrior appeared in the door, and Moorooine
sunk behind the one she loved, as noiseless as a shadow!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>The warrior stood a moment, and then entered, peering
around the gloomy interior. Pausing before the prisoner,
he assured himself that the latter’s wrists and ankles were
well secured and then passed out again among the excited
throng.</p>

<p>The moment he disappeared, Moorooine glided beside the
aroused ranger and quickly severed the thongs about his wrists.</p>

<p>“Don’t stir till I tell you!” she whispered. “Me go out
first an’ find best way to git off an’ cheat warriors.”</p>

<p>“God bless ye, my own sweet Wild Flower,” said the
young man, fervently, as he pressed her heaving bosom
against his own, and his lips to hers. “You risk your life
for mine.”</p>

<p>“Mustn’t—no time now,” she said, releasing herself. “Put
hands together again as before; use this knife to loose feet
when time come.”</p>

<p>He obeyed her instantly. The noise outside precluded their
being heard. They might be seen, though the guard having
just passed out after looking at the prisoner, it was not probable
he would soon return. But both kept a sharp watch as
they talked.</p>

<p>“If I escape, you go with me,” said Brom.</p>

<p>“Yes; go help you clear.”</p>

<p>“You must go with me for <em>good</em>, Moorooine. I want you
always. You shall be my wife.”</p>

<p>“Talk of that when more time,” she said. “Go with you
<em>now</em> first. Have to for always, s’pose, or else warriors kill
me.”</p>

<p>“Be very careful. If you should be found out, they’d kill
you. That would make my life bitter. You must not die for
me.”</p>

<p>“Would <em>willin’</em> if need,” she said, as she pressed his hand.
“There—now must go, hurry. Be back very quick!”</p>

<p>She noiselessly crept through the aperture and closed it.
Then, with great caution, she glided forward, and passed behind
a huge bowlder, from which a path led down a declivity to
the river. She darted down the path, and in five minutes returned.
Her own canoe was in its accustomed place, and between
the rows of lodges yet came the sounds of engrossing
discussion. The moment had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>With beating heart she approached the prison-hut. But
two figures hovering near rose and barred her way. They were
those of Hulet and the savage before mentioned! A feeling
of the bitterest disappointment and dread filled her soul as she
recognized Sly Hate, whom till now she thought killed. But
she quailed not.</p>

<p>“Come this way,” said the Indian, who was called Heavy
Sleep. The girl could but obey, and the trio moved further
aside.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said Heavy Sleep, as they halted. “Sporting
Fawn has been much in woods to-night to warn our enemies,
who have killed many warriors. Sly Hate has seen you, so
there is no chance to tell lies, if you would. None of the
warriors know this yet but Heavy Sleep. If they should find
out, then what?”</p>

<p>“Then I would be killed,” she answered, while a shudder
passed over her. She knew the object of Heavy Sleep.
He had long sought her hand, but in vain. He was accounted
a cruel monster, even among his own tribe; capable of committing
any atrocity to gratify revenge. Many hated him,
while fearing his malice. And now he held the girl’s life in
his hand, and well she knew the price he would ask for it.
The thought of this was what made her shudder.</p>

<p>“Yes, be killed <em>hard</em>!” he said. “But, I will save you if
you will be my squaw. None of the warriors shall ever know
of what you have done to-night. Be my squaw and <em>live</em>.
Speak!”</p>

<p>“And if I say no?”</p>

<p>“Then I shall take you into the midst of the warriors yonder,
and Sly Hate will tell his story,” replied Heavy Sleep,
grasping her arm.</p>

<p>“Hearken, Heavy Sleep!” she said. “It is true that I have
been in the woods; but it was to save blood, not to spill it.
Many times, as you know, I have risked the favor of my people
by urging them to live at peace with the whites.”</p>

<p>The savage clutched her arm more tightly and said:</p>

<p>“No need to say that again. We all know it. You love pale
faces. That is enough to make you die! I and Sly Hate
have watched you. You are even now going to find White
Fox so as to get him away. But you never try. Which will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
you do? Be my squaw, or burn at the stake with the whole
tribe mocking and hating your memory? Which?”</p>

<p>The girl could not repress a shudder, which the savage noticed.
It was a terrible choice. But, her wits did not forsake
her. She saw that Heavy Sleep and his ally had just come
up, and did not know she already had communicated with
White Fox.</p>

<p>“Move aside and give me time to think alone!” she replied,
as she drew her arm away, and looked upward at the stars.
“I am much afraid you would hate me after a while, Heavy
Sleep. You would get tired of me, and then give me up to
the vengeance of the tribe.”</p>

<p>“No!” replied the Indian, with a degree less of harshness
in his tone. “Heavy Sleep would keep his word. Give you
a little time; but think <em>fast</em>. We shall be watching you.”</p>

<p>He passed a few yards away with Hulet. The girl’s
thoughts came and went like lightning. Heavy Sleep evidently
believed she would consent, with such a fearful alternative
before her. But she was fully resolved to attempt the
release of Brom, if she died for it. While trying to devise
some desperate expedient, a drift of clouds suddenly shut out
the starlight, and she knew that, for a moment, her body
would hardly be seen. She glided straight forward, as though
to pass between the two nearest huts. But, instead of doing
so, she suddenly turned and darted to the left; and by the
time her two watchers had discovered her <em>ruse</em>, she was in the
prison-hut beside Brom.</p>

<p>“It’s the last chance—<em>run</em>!” she exclaimed, in a wild
whisper.</p>

<p>The young ranger had no time to question her, or even to
think. Steps were heard close to the aperture where the girl
had just entered. The moment she spoke, Brom cut the
thongs about his ankles, and sprung up to encounter the guard,
who had heard a noise and rushed to the door. A blow from
Brom knocked the fellow prostrate, and, before the throng
outside were well aware of it, a figure darted clear of their
circle and ran like a deer toward the woods!</p>

<p>The air was rent with fierce yells as the crowd broke and
pursued. Brom saw that he could not reach the woods in
time to get clear. Within ten feet of the bluff he turned, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
with one bound leaped into the deep, swift current, not twenty
feet above the mouth of the subterranean passage!</p>

<p>As he disappeared in the water, an excited crowd appeared
on the bank, astonished into momentary silence by the act.
And when the moments passed, and no form broke the waters,
none doubted that the prisoner had been swept into the
subterranean passage, a victim to the evil spirit presiding
there.</p>

<p>The Indian girl attempted to escape with Brom; but Heavy
Sleep, as implacable as death, gave no thought then but to
her capture. She, indeed, sprung clear of the lodge, and as
Brom fled, with the crowd after him, she started in the same
direction with the pursuers. As she suddenly darted aside
from these, Heavy Sleep spied her, and, throwing his hatchet
struck her senseless to the ground.</p>

<p>These scenes took place only a few minutes before Scarred
Eagle and Mace came within view of the camp. Of what
followed, the reader is already aware.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter nobreak">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="p75">A BLOODY TROPHY.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Scarred Eagle</span> well knew whence the shots came. The
moment the Indians rushed from the lodge he glided from beneath
the pile of skins, and quickly freed the limbs of
Moorooine.</p>

<p>“Courage, girl,” he whispered. “I b’l’eve Brom’s saved.
We must git out o’ this afore they come back!”</p>

<p>As he spoke he sprung from her side, and peering out
saw the Indians yet rushing pell-mell toward the high bank
of the river.</p>

<p>“Now’s our time—come!” he added, turning to the Indian
girl.</p>

<p>She had started to her feet, filled with a new strength at
the thought that Brom was saved and her own escape probable.
But as Rhodan was about to glide out he caught a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
glimpse of a figure moving up from the left of the entrance.
There was no time to ensconce himself under the pile of skins.
Instead, he crouched close to the side of the lodge, and
Moorooine sunk back to her former attitude.</p>

<p>They had barely time to do this when a savage entered
hastily and stood beside the girl.</p>

<p>“Sporting Fawn too young to die,” he said. “If come to
my lodge an’ be my squaw, take ’er dar now in canoe. Mus’
come quick!”</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew his knife, and bent low to cut her
bonds. The sudden discovery that these were no longer
upon her caused the fellow to straighten up in astonishment.
He had no time to question her or even to glance
around. A quick, powerful blow from behind laid him senseless.
Moorooine again sprung to her feet, and the next moment
was gliding across to the opposite row of huts after Scarred
Eagle. The moment they were behind these they turned toward
the north. But they had not gone more than twenty
yards when, amid the general noise of alarm, they heard the
ringing cry of the warrior whom they had just evaded.</p>

<p>It was lucky for them the fellow raised the cry, for it was
answered by others whom in a moment more the fugitives
would have met.</p>

<p>At the moment they were near a large square hut, and having
no time to do better, crouched close beside it.</p>

<p>The Indians rushed past them, and were for a moment hid
from view by an intervening lodge. The cry had recalled others
from the vicinity of the subterranean passage, and these were
heard rushing up.</p>

<p>“Must git in here if can—quick!” whispered the girl.</p>

<p>It was a desperate attempt; but more dangerous to remain
still or attempt to run further. They crept rapidly forward,
and at a moment when the backs of the startled Indians were
toward them, darted inside.</p>

<p>“This council-house,” said the girl. “Mebbe not look here
soon. Best hide up there!”</p>

<p>She hurriedly pointed overhead to rude beams laid across
from side to side. Half the space was floored with small
rough logs. The cabin had evidently been reared by some
French trapper. With a lightning movement Scarred Eagle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
lifted her up, almost as soon as the suggestion was made, and
as she obtained a footing he sprung up after her.</p>

<p>For the time they were safe. Words can give no idea of the
excitement and confusion that now prevailed. It was frenzied.
The last fifteen minutes had marked the death of Heavy Sleep
and the renegade, the escape of Mace, the occurrence of the
shots; and as a climax, some other deadly, unseen foe had
snatched one from captivity on whom the savages had calculated
to execute a terrible vengeance! No wonder these
events, so rapidly succeeding each other, made them crazy
with alarm and confusion.</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle and Moorooine lost not a second in moving
close to the eaves of the roof and stretching themselves at
length.</p>

<p>They heard the baffled savages darting around the outside
of the cabin. Some of them entered it, but were evidently
satisfied with the fact that no one was below, without thinking
to look aloft. Others ran rapidly to the north, east and
west, beating every spot that might for a moment conceal a
fugitive.</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle was able to judge very nearly of the disposition
of his enemies. He knew that at least half a dozen were
after Mace. He little feared for the latter; but ever since the
shots came, he feared that those at the retreat had unwittingly
led the savages to suspect their hiding-place. In that case the
capture of all would be only a question of time.</p>

<p>He realized the precarious situation of himself and the
Indian girl: at any moment they might be discovered. Still
there was a hope—a bare chance that they might remain there
till night came. Pending that time there seemed not the
least possible chance of escape, even should they remain undiscovered.</p>

<p>In half an hour it was fully light. Meantime, from the
shouts and cries, Rhodan knew the searchers were still at
work. On every side of the village the search had been keen
and simultaneous. How would it end?</p>

<p>Through a crevice in the logs he managed, at last, to get a
view of the ground near the subterranean passage. It was
not occupied, and the fact cheered him. It was evident that
the savages believed the daring authors of the shots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
had escaped down the banks of the river. Some were still
absent on their trail, leaving the rest to look for the daring
enemy who had liberated the Indian girl.</p>

<p>These soon returned to the center of the village. There
was about a score of them in all. Their looks showed that
their poor success was operating on their superstitious notions.
Could it be possible they believed their last unknown enemy
had escaped, and that they had given o’er the search?</p>

<p>This was the question Scarred Eagle asked himself. Moorooine
had softly gained a position at his side, and was listening
to the excited conversation going on but a little distance
away.</p>

<p>“Good—very good!” she whispered, at length.</p>

<p>“What is it, gal?” inquired Scarred Eagle, anxiously.</p>

<p>“The canoe gone!” she answered, drawing a breath of relief.</p>

<p>“What canoe, Moorooine?”</p>

<p>“Mine. They s’pose we took an’ escaped!”</p>

<p>“Is that what they say—ar’ ye sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes; sure. We safe for more longer anyway. S’pose
white friends safe too—all safe? Why s’pose White Fox
safe?”</p>

<p>“I judge he is from what you told me an’ from what I
noticed when I crept into the village. You said he got away
but was drowned in the river.”</p>

<p>“Yes; seen ’im run—jump in, above the dark passage.
Bad place—bad spirit lives there.”</p>

<p>“That’s one o’ the foolish notions of y’ur people, Moorooine;
but Brom ain’t afraid o’ the place. I’ve gre’t hopes ’twas the
means o’ savin’ him.”</p>

<p>He briefly explained the nature of the place to her, adding
that he had no doubt the rangers were at that moment concealed
there. She listened with great interest.</p>

<p>“Good,” she said. “They help us if can, then.”</p>

<p>“Thar’s jist a hope; but it’s a slim one,” said the scout.
“If they take a notion to s’arch this place we’ll be lost, sartin.
If we kin keep hid till night comes ag’in—eh, what’s
hatchin’ now?”</p>

<p>They listened, Moorooine keeping her ear close to the
crevice. Suddenly she turned her head and peeped out. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
recognized the warrior whose proposition to save her an hour
before had been so suddenly interrupted by Scarred Eagle.</p>

<p>The quick-witted Indian girl understood all at a glance.
The fellow had not told of his own mishap, only that he had
found the girl gone. He well knew she could not have got
far away, and, failing to find her around the village, had a
suspicion she was secreted somewhere within. The missing
canoe did not satisfy him. He was now pointing toward the
council-house, asking if the <em>loft had been searched</em>!</p>

<p>“No hope now, only for <em>you</em>!” whispered Moorooine,
sadly.</p>

<p>She rose suddenly to her feet, and had taken one step forward,
when Scarred Eagle, surmising her intent, pulled her
back.</p>

<p>“No; not yit!” he said. “Ye’ve put y’ur life at stake <em>once</em>
to git the boy safe, an’ you ain’t a-goin’ ter resk it for me,
by throwin’ y’urself into their hands. Git down thar ag’in
quicker!”</p>

<p>He fairly crowded her into the aperture, between the log-floor
and the roof. Then, with steady agility, he darted past
her, and established himself in a similar attitude. At that
moment three or four Indians entered below, and one of them,
assisted by the rest, seized the beam, and drew himself over it.
The concealed borderer knew that several moments would
elapse before the Indian’s gaze would become used to the gloom
in the loft. Even then, he might not think it worth while to
cross over, and look into the narrow space where they lay concealed.</p>

<p>But the savage did not wait. Urged by the impatient
queries of those below, he at once stalked forward and glanced
around. He must have seen that no lurkers were upon the
floor, but a mere whim prompted him to advance toward the
further side. A round, white object caught his eye, and as
he bent toward it, something struck him in the forehead and
face, causing him to start back with a howl of pain. He
whirled rapidly, and grasping the beam, began to descend, pursued
by dozens of yellow-jackets, which, not to be partial,
pitched into his companions. In less than a minute, not only
the loft, but the cabin was vacated, except by Scarred Eagle
and the Indian girl. These two, lying quite still, cared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
little for the stings they themselves had received. Long
after the Indians had left the spot, they remained in the same
attitude, not only as a measure of safety, but to allow the
disturbed hornets time to settle.</p>

<p>In an hour, Scarred Eagle cautiously rose, and Moorooine
followed his example. They had not for a moment failed to
hear sounds outside, coming from those who mourned their
dead, or from those who kept coming in from a fruitless
search.</p>

<p>“They no come here ag’in,” said the Indian girl, hopefully.
“How do that?”</p>

<p>“We scouts l’arn to make use of sarcumstances that
other ’uns wouldn’t notice,” replied Rhodan. “That nest was
jest at my head, an’ ’twasn’t much work ter rile the little
chaps. Ay; there comes more!”</p>

<p>The Indians began to come in fast, from the west and
south. Three hours passed, and little took place in the village
worthy of record. The concealed scout and his companion
began to feel weak from their past terrible exertions.
Hunger and thirst, too, tormented them. But there was nothing
but to wait and watch in suspense. Scarred Eagle began
to fear, and with reason, that those in the cave would be unable
to assist them. Even if there were no new alarms, the
camp would be too vigilant for them to escape that night.
Meantime the warriors, whether successful or unsuccessful,
would all be in, so that it would be madness for the rangers
to attempt his liberation, even if they could know where he
was.</p>

<p>They would probably suppose he had effected his escape,
and search for him miles away. But he knew Brom would
prosecute the search till death.</p>

<p>The sun was considerably past the meridian, when, from
their look-out, they saw a number of Indians start up, and
advance toward the forest on the south. A moment later, they
heard sounds denoting an arrival.</p>

<p>“It’s plain all on ’em ain’t in yit,” whispered Scarred Eagle.
“I don’t know what’s kep’ ’em so long, onless—ay, thar they
come!”</p>

<p>A dozen or more came into view. They were greeted with
yells of delight by those already in camp, who rushed forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
to meet them. As they advanced into the center of the camp,
Rhodan noticed they had a prisoner, and soon discovered it
was Tim Devine. A pang of sorrow filled the breast of
Scarred Eagle. He knew the faithful fellow had been taken,
while endeavoring to draw the Indians off. His arms were
closely pinioned behind, his hunting-frock was nearly torn off,
and his face was covered with blood. What had become of
his companion, Dan Hicks?</p>

<p>It was a silent query soon answered. The excited crowd
thronged around, filling the air with gratified yells at the prospect
of having one live victim for torture. As they swayed
to and fro, jeering and buffeting the prisoner, one of them
exhibited two bloody scalps of white men. One of these
Rhodan recognized as that of poor Hicks; and the other—he
feared, with a shudder, that it belonged to Ben Mace!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter nobreak">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="p75">A SUDDEN REPRIEVE.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Preparations</span> were at once made to torture the prisoner.
He was led, or pushed, forward directly toward the council-house.
A rude post was soon sunk in the ground, and to this
he was securely lashed.</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle set his teeth hard, and glanced keenly toward
the rocky bluff. He had a good view of it from his perch.
He could not believe the rangers were yet gone. They had
not had a chance to steal away, even on the supposition that
their leader had escaped from the village. They must, therefore,
have noticed the arrival of the warriors with their prisoner;
if so, he felt assured they would undertake something
for the brave Irishman. He saw what they might do; but
would they think to undertake it?</p>

<p>As if in answer to his thoughts, he suddenly caught glimpse
of two figures gliding along the edge of the woods toward
the west. The view was but momentary, but it made his
gray eye flash with satisfaction. It was the first sign he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
seen, telling that the rangers were on the alert since morning.</p>

<p>“What do now?” said the Indian girl, speaking close to
his ear.</p>

<p>She had been watching those below them with fearful
interest.</p>

<p>“Nothing yit, girl. But there may be a chance for us to
gi’n ’em the slip soon. We must be ready.”</p>

<p>“Too bad—sorry!” she said, glancing through at the
howling rabble about Devine. “’Fraid we can no help
him. No git away ourselves till dark comes. He be burnt
then.”</p>

<p>“The warriors don’t b’l’eve but what the rest on us ar’
well out o’ the region,” explained the other. “But two o’
the chaps ar’ workin’ round an’ I’ve no doubt’ll interrupt
this work at the right minit!”</p>

<p>“What? You see ’em?”</p>

<p>“Not a minit ago. When the alarm comes we must down
an’ put for the river while the rest ar’ off.”</p>

<p>“Then, if can, take him?”</p>

<p>“The Irishman—yis. I’ll look at him. It’s likely we’ll
have help. Ay, they’ve begun thar deviltries!”</p>

<p>The fierce maledictions and threats, delivered occasionally
in broken English, ceased at this moment. Standing a few
feet away, a half-dozen of the more experienced warriors
began to test the nerves of the victim by throwing their
knives toward him. On either side of his head struck the
dangerous missiles, burying themselves in the post. The
Irishman never winced. Evidently he had schooled himself
for the trial. Of course due care was taken not to strike
him fatally, as that would have shortened his coming period
of torture by fire.</p>

<p>Full half an hour was thus occupied, when the programme
was changed by introducing hatchets. These were thrown
with such skill that they were allowed to clip the straggling
locks of the victim’s hair, without touching his head. But
at last, either accidentally or by design, one of the performers
in the game threw his weapon cutting off a portion of the
victim’s ear!</p>

<p>The yells that now arose, proclaimed that a new feature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
of the torture had begun. And Scarred Eagle knew that
the victim would be pierced or struck about the arms and
shoulders, till he was deemed fit for the flames.</p>

<p>“Eh! How pale-dog like it?” inquired one of the crew
as he seized Devine’s hair.</p>

<p>Up to this moment the latter had not uttered a word or a
groan. But now, probably hoping to provoke this tormentor
to finish the work at once, he managed to draw back
one foot, and suddenly planted it in the fellow’s stomach,
pitching him backward upon the ground!</p>

<p>“Dthere, ye double-dom’d haithen, do y’ur worst, so!”</p>

<p>Like lightning the worsted Indian sprung to his feet and
rushed back with upright weapon. At this instant two rifle-reports
rung out, telling with deadly effect among the crowd.
And hardly had the echoes of the first ceased, when another
rifle spoke from behind the council-house! Three in all, telling
as many deaths.</p>

<p>“Now—down quickly!” was the excited command of
Scarred Eagle.</p>

<p>Both sprung down and rushed out. By the time this was
accomplished the frenzied crowd were rushing like mad devils
in the direction of the shots.</p>

<p>“Push for the bluff!” cried Rhodan to the Indian girl;
and as he spoke he sprung to the side of Devine. But the
latter had already nearly got his arms loose, and one dash
with Scarred Eagle’s knife completed the work.</p>

<p>“Och! Howly Mother—”</p>

<p>“Away with ye—<em>run</em>!”</p>

<p>The Irishman bounded off. As Scarred Eagle started he
cast a quick glance back and saw that half a dozen of the
Indians, notwithstanding the sudden confusion, had caught a
glimpse of what was going on and were rushing back like a
tornado. At the same moment a startling shout at his left
caused him to turn his head. Two Indians had already
reached the spot, having rushed up behind the council-house.</p>

<p>One of these had pounced upon the Indian girl, and his
hatchet was already elevated, when the shout, came quickly
followed by a blow so powerful that the fellow dropped to
rise no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Run, Moorooine—take the one after Tim, Revel—ah-ha,
Rhodan, here the devils come!”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Brom Vail. Scarred Eagle had already
raised his rifle as the young man spoke; and as the words
left his lips, their rifles spoke together. The Indians involuntarily
halted before the shock, while Rhodan and Brom
turned like lightning and sprung toward the bluff. Revel had
just felled the Indian who pursued Devine. The latter was
near the bluff, the Indian girl quite near him.</p>

<p>“Push on!” cried Revel; and as he spoke he raised his
rifle. <em>Two</em> reports rung out, and instinctively Scarred Eagle
and Brom turned.</p>

<p>“Have at the devils an’ save Mace—hyar ’e comes!”</p>

<p>And as Scarred Eagle spoke, the three bounded toward the
remaining Indians; but the latter wheeled and struck toward
the forest, as a stentorian voice behind yelled:</p>

<p>“Spring on for y’ur lives! The hull pack o’ hellions ar’
turnin’ back!”</p>

<p>A few desperate springs brought them to the bluff, where,
dodging behind a bowlder, they found Devine guarding the
passage, the Indian girl having already entered.</p>

<p>Mace was the last to creep in, and he had just time to do
so, and close up the passage, when a score of Indians dashed
upon the rocks. As he crept on after the rest down the narrow,
rugged passage, he kept filling it behind him in such a
manner that it would take hours for an enemy from <em>without</em>
to force it. And yet he could not help thinking it might be
their last hiding-place on earth.</p>

<p>Only faint, rumbling echoes came to the ears of the fugitives
as they passed to the subterranean chamber. But they
had no reason to doubt the doubly enraged Miamis knew
where they were concealed, and would watch them to the last
extremity.</p>

<p>Of course, midnight darkness reigned in the chamber; but
it was provided with pine torches, and one of these was soon
lighted. All of them were too much excited to converse for
a time. Not five minutes had elapsed since the work of torture
was interrupted; and now, behold, all except Goodbrand
and Hill were safe from present danger.</p>

<p>The arms of Brom tenderly supported the Indian girl.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
The Irishman had sunk down exhausted; and Scarred Eagle,
warmly shaking the hands of his deliverers, was rapidly informed
of their several adventures, and they then began to
consult anxiously.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter nobreak">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="p75">THE FORLORN HOPE.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> appearance of Ben Mace in the last scene may be
briefly explained.</p>

<p>When he sprung away from the side of Scarred Eagle, it
was not yet light. His pursuers were just able to catch the
outlines of his figure as it disappeared in the bushes. He
did not doubt his ability to escape by a straight run from the
village; but he knew such a course would necessitate a long
run and prevent his giving any further assistance to his friends.</p>

<p>One of Scarred Eagle’s expedients suggested itself, and with
the thought he acted. Seizing a stone, he hurled it down
the slope of ground, and then dodged close behind a bowlder.
In the brief space necessary to do this, the pursuers dashed
through the bushes, and in a second were past him. He rose
quickly, and circling to the right, began to approach the upper
extremity of the village.</p>

<p>The nature of the shouts and confusion led him to believe
Rhodan was already a prisoner. He rightly conjectured that
he might safely venture to the river-bank, and secrete himself,
or have opportunity to join the party in the subterranean
passage.</p>

<p>Favored by the degree of gloom still prevailing, he succeeded
in reaching the opposite side of the camp, listening
with wild anxiety to the Babel of cries all around him.
He was about to hurry to the side of the river, when he
obtained a view of the horde who at that moment brought
the bodies of Hulet and Sly Hate from the rear of the hut.
He had then no doubt his friend was certainly a prisoner, if
not killed, and resolved to at once attempt joining those in
the retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>He glided down the very path Moorooine had taken an hour
before. To his surprise he noticed a tall Indian gliding before
him in the same direction. Without pausing to think
what the fellow’s object could be, he followed him close, till
the latter reached the water, where a light canoe was drawn
up. Into this the Indian hastily deposited a rifle and several
other articles. Having done this, he wheeled about, and Mace
was just in time to conceal himself in the shrubbery.</p>

<p>The Indian passed him, springing up the acclivity as if intent
on some personal errand requiring great haste. As he
disappeared, Mace laid his own rifle in the canoe, which he
began to push swiftly toward the subterranean passage. He
kept close under the bank, having no fears but that he would
be able to accomplish his purpose undiscovered.</p>

<p>Within ten yards of the entrance he heard the reports of
the rifles and the yells and rush that followed. And the next
moment he swept into the passage and gained the rocky recess,
where, to his deep surprise, he found not only the three
rangers, who had just fled from above, but Brom Vail.</p>

<p>The three rangers had witnessed the commotion, and poured
in the volley in hopes of diverting pursuit of the men whom
they hoped had got a start from camp. The explanation of
Mace, while it shed a little light upon the situation, left the fate
of Scarred Eagle and Moorooine involved in uncertainty. They
little knew that at that very moment the latter were snugly
secreted in the very heart of the village.</p>

<p>A number of hours passed before they found opportunity
to take a look over the camp—hours full of the deepest anxiety
and suspense. Brom Vail at last managed to peer out,
and saw that the Indians had withdrawn from the spot. Their
hiding-place was yet unknown, but the Indians were gathered
in knots in the midst of the camp. What had become of
Rhodan and the Indian girl?</p>

<p>There was not yet a chance to leave the retreat without
being discovered, and chafing with impatience, they consulted
and watched during the long hours. At last, near nightfall,
the coveted chance of stealing out was opened by the arrival
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse</i> bringing Devine a prisoner.</p>

<p>The plan of Brom was acted upon the moment the savage
orgies commenced. Three were to steal around to the west<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
and pour in a volley into the savage crew, volunteering to
undertake the perilous task, and risk escape. Brom Vail, with
Revel, took it upon himself to steal along the bank of the
river, and attempt two things: the release of the Irishman,
and to learn, if possible, something concerning Rhodan and
the Indian girl. The young man was filled with sad forebodings
in regard to these. His great joy, then, at the last
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i> may be imagined.</p>

<p>But their situation was yet extremely perilous, and all realized
it. Of course an attempt to leave through the passage
they had just entered was not to be thought of. And the
water-passage—would not the terribly-aroused Indians guard
its entrance, believing it communicated with their retreat?</p>

<p>“There’s little doubt of it,” said Brom, as they consulted.
“They must ’a’ seen me in the scrimmage just now, an’ known
me. That ’ud be enough, ’cos they know how I escaped afore.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe they <em>didn’t</em> know ye,” said Mace. “They hedn’t
a chance ter look close, as to thet. Besides, you forgit that
y’ur rig’s different frum what ’twas. Thet canoe I brought in
helped ye to a change o’ garments as well’s to a rifle.”</p>

<p>At this moment dull sounds came faintly to their ears from
above.</p>

<p>“The devils ar’ workin’!” remarked Scarred Eagle. “Take
hold o’ here, Mace!”</p>

<p>The latter assisted him to push one of the canoes into the
water. Scarred Eagle stepped in. Mace was about to follow.</p>

<p>“No, Ben,” said the other. “Wait here with the rest.
One’s enough to reconnoiter now.”</p>

<p>He pushed off in the darkness, the others anxiously awaiting
the result. Meantime they ever and anon put their ears
close to the upward passage. The Miamis above were still
at work endeavoring to force an entrance.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed and Scarred Eagle came back with the
canoe. The news he brought was any thing but encouraging.
He had advanced far enough to see that a number of the enemy
stood upon the high bank of the river, with their gaze
fixed upon the subterranean entrance.</p>

<p>“They sartin suspect that it leads to our retreat,” he said.
“But one thing ag’in’ ’em is ’t they ain’t got any canoes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>Thet is, none thet I could diskiver.”</p>

<p>“Some above!” said Moorooine. “Up near fort. Mebbe
git them.”</p>

<p>“It may be they will, gal,” said Rhodan. “We’ll know in
the course of an hour. It’ll be dark by that time.”</p>

<p>The veteran scout sat down upon the hard bottom of the
cave and became silent. There seemed no further chance for
that species of strategy of which he was so perfect a master.
A few hours would decide their fate, and all knew it.</p>

<p>A small keg of spirits and a quantity of jerked venison had
been found in the canoe which Mace had brought in. All
partook sparingly, and then, seeing that their weapons were in
the best possible order, huddled together awaiting events.</p>

<p>At last the sounds made by the enemy above them ceased.
They had evidently become satisfied that they were expending
their strength for nothing. What would they next do?</p>

<p>“Ain’t it dark outside by this time?” inquired Brom at
last.</p>

<p>“No, not yet,” replied Scarred Eagle. “It’s no use o’
pokin’ out that way till we’re sure ’tis.”</p>

<p>At this moment they heard the echoes of shouts above the
dull roar of the waters. They at once knew the sounds must
have come from near the east side of the camp, else they could
not have reached their ears.</p>

<p>The rangers huddled close to the edge of the landing, and
bent forward.</p>

<p>“The hellions ar’ makin’ ready to come at us here,” said
Mace, grimly.</p>

<p>“Not yit,” remarked Scarred Eagle, who had stepped into
the canoe in order to hear better. “I’d sooner think one or
both of the others ar’ taken.”</p>

<p>“I kain’t b’l’eve but what they got off. I see ’em run the
minit they fired. Thar couldn’t ’a’ b’en many thet follered
’em. The row we made brought most on ’em back. ’Twould
be jest like the chaps to turn back ag’in the minit thar come
a chance, though.”</p>

<p>“The Lord help ’em ef they <em>be</em> took, now,” said Scarred
Eagle. “No kind of a chance ’s left <em>us</em> to help ’em, when
thar’s so small a prospect o’ helpin’ ourselves. Step in here,
Ben, an’ we’ll steal out a piece towarts the entrance.”</p>

<p>As the latter obeyed, Rhodan turned toward Brom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Tother canoe ’ll hold the rest on ye, boy. Ef ye hear a
stone splash in the water hereaway, push out at once.”</p>

<p>In a moment longer he had turned the angle and disappeared.</p>

<p>Those behind now stationed themselves where they could
hear the least unusual sound. None of them attempted to
converse. Their suspense was too deep.</p>

<p>Half an hour thus passed, or rather dragged; for to those
waiting, it seemed hours. What could keep Scarred Eagle
and Mace? Directing Revel to steady the remaining canoe,
Brom stepped to its further end, and managed to obtain a view
outward. He saw an outline of the other canoe drawing silently
toward him through the gloom, and far beyond he
plainly distinguished one or two moving bodies, revealed by
the degree of light prevailing outside.</p>

<p>As he stepped back, Scarred Eagle and Mace glided to the
chamber and landed. Their report was not a cheering one.
As Brom had suspected, the Indians in their canoes were
watching the mouth of the passage.</p>

<p>“We must git to work quick!” said Scarred Eagle. “Them
out yonder ain’t sure we’re in here, though they suspect it.
Mebbe we kin cheat ’em ag’in.”</p>

<p>“Work is it?” exclaimed the Irishman. “I’m ready dthin—pwat’ll
be doon?”</p>

<p>“It shall be your part to keep watch with Moorooine an’
see if them in the canoes ondertake to come in. The rest on
us ’ll work at the passage in the rocks. Mace thinks thar’s
a prospect of workin’ our way up so ’s to fire occasionally on
them watchin’ above us. If we kin, it may draw ’em away
from the mouth of the passage an’ gi’n us a chance to steal
out in the canoes.”</p>

<p>Mace had already begun to remove some of the obstructions
placed in the rocky passage. The rest fell to work with a
will, leaving Devine and the Indian girl to watch the passage
outward.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, the way up through the rocks was devious
and rough, and nearly thirty feet in extent. Half-way up was a kind of
niche where three men might stand abreast. The rangers hoped to be able
to fire upon the savages from this point. Could they do so, the Indians
might possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
believe the rocky passage extended no further, and withdraw those who
were stationed at the mouth of the water-passage.</p>

<p>They worked with the energy of men who realized that life
is the stake. There was little danger of their being heard,
as it was much easier to remove obstructions from the inside
than from without.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they reached the desired point. Pausing
they heard sounds, proclaiming the Indians had again resumed
work.</p>

<p>“They’re gittin’ on faster now,” said Mace. “I judge
they’ve got that big stone moved, but it’s cost ’em more ’n a
good hours work. Ha—look out!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, a rumbling, heavy jar was felt, as a huge
rock fell forward, lodging a few feet above them! Mace
chuckled grimly.</p>

<p>“Thar! Ye see it got the better of the scamps. Thet ar
was fixed for jest sich an occasion as this, but was never used
afore. Now, it’s in sich shape that we couldn’t git out o’
here ourselves in less ’n half a day ef thar wa’n’t no one round
to interfere.”</p>

<p>“It’s bad!” remarked Scarred Eagle. “We won’t have a
chance to let ’em know we’re here except by shouting, an’
they’d see through that. If we could git in a shot or two
now, they’d b’l’eve we war in the last extremity.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, “thump, thump,” came sounds from above.
Pressing up as far as possible, between the wall and obstructions
before them, he obtained a view of several dark figures
relieved against a starlit sky in the distance.</p>

<p>“That bowlder broke a section of the ledge as it fell, an’
the devils ar’ makin’ thar way round it,” he whispered. “It’s
jest the thing after all—reach my rifle here, Revel!”</p>

<p>Mace had made the discovery as soon as Rhodan. Revel
handed them their weapons, and stepped back.</p>

<p>“Push y’ur weepon up as far as ye kin,” cautioned Scarred
Eagle. “The report ’ll be less likely to echo back below
us.”</p>

<p>But they withheld their fire. The Indians had suddenly
ceased their work again, and not a glimpse of them could be
seen. Minute after minute passed of unbroken silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“I had hoped they’d keep on!” said Scarred Eagle. “But
their crazy rage is coolin’. Thet’s what’s made ’em work,
when they mout ’a’ waited an b’en jest ’s sure. Ah-ha—what’s
ter pay now?”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter nobreak">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="p75">NOOKECHIN.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Irishman had scrambled up, and stood beside them.</p>

<p>“For dthe luv of God coom below, quick!” he exclaimed.
“Dthe rats are movin’ in wud the boats!”</p>

<p>“You an’ Revel keep here, Mace. You’ll know if
wanted!”</p>

<p>And as Scarred Eagle thus spoke, he hurried down after
the Irishman. He found the Indian girl standing as far out
as possible, gazing up the water-passage. Coming on slowly,
were two canoes, each containing three or four Indians. They
could be plainly distinguished, for a torch was fixed in the
prow of the one ahead. It only cast light a few yards ahead
and around them, so that the watchers had no fears of being
discovered, till the canoe should approach nearer.</p>

<p>“They want to come, but ’fraid to,” whispered Moorooine.</p>

<p>“It shows they’ve doubts ’bout thar bein’ a hidin’-place in
here. <em>That’s</em> in our favor, anyhow. Ef we could only make
’em b’l’eve thar w’an’t any, we’d soon git clear.”</p>

<p>The canoes came on very cautiously. Suddenly, the Indians,
feeling the increased current, began to dip their paddles
to prevent moving too fast. The one nearest the torch seized
it, and waved it from side to side, examining the walls. But,
save at the secret chamber, there was not the least cavity in
the rocks.</p>

<p>They held their canoes nearly motionless, and peered into
the unknown darkness. Evidently they did not like the idea
of venturing further. They were not rid of the superstition
about the place, and the gloomy depths, beyond, from which
came a sullen roar, made them nervous.</p>

<p>Suddenly a prolonged, dull echo came to the ears of Scarred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
Eagle and Moorooine. They knew it was caused by rifle-reports
up in the passage. Those in the canoes heard the
echoes; but to them it was of frightful significance. Mingled
with the sullen roar in the depths, it doubtless seemed to their
startled imaginations, that the evil spirit of the cave was
about to take vengeance on them for their temerity. At any
rate, they pulled back with the utmost dispatch.</p>

<p>Leaving Moorooine to watch, Scarred Eagle sprung back
and hastened up the passage. As he gained the spot, he
heard yells outside plainly.</p>

<p>“We’ve hit one o’ the curs—what’s goin’ on below?” cried
Mace. “Is thar a chance—”</p>

<p>“Yes; come on for y’ur lives!” interrupted Scarred Eagle.</p>

<p>They hurried back into the chamber.</p>

<p>“Ar’ they in sight, Moorooine?” called Rhodan.</p>

<p>“No; all gone!” said the girl, joyfully.</p>

<p>“Then out with these ’ere, quick!”</p>

<p>Both canoes were at once launched. In the foremost and
largest, four of the rangers took their places. Brom and
Moorooine followed in the other.</p>

<p>As they moved forward, they heard the sounds of excitement,
which told that the savages were rushing to the spot,
where, as they doubtless supposed, their enemies were attempting
a desperate resistance.</p>

<p>“Steady!” cautioned Scarred Eagle, as they neared the
mouth of the rocky channel. “We must feel our way for a
minit or two. T’other canoes may not be out o’ the way.”</p>

<p>Two minutes later they stopped, and peered ahead. Not a
sign of a canoe could they see; yet those that had ventured
into the passage could not yet have had time to land. To do
so, they would be obliged to move a distance up where the
bank was more sloping. There was no danger that these
might be lying to the right or left of the entrance, behind the
juts of cliff.</p>

<p>The rangers consulted a moment. They were far enough
to see the reflection of starlight on the water further out.
Had it been darker, they would not have hesitated to risk an
attempt to start out. They concluded to move close up beside
the right wall, and then steal up and endeavor to obtain a
view of the opposite side of the entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>The canoes came nearly up to the wall, when Devine, glancing
back, saw something floating toward them.</p>

<p>“Luk!” he said, in a wild whisper.</p>

<p>The object was where the starlight shone upon it. As the
rest turned it disappeared from sight. At the same moment,
shouts came from the right of the entrance, and a canoe was
heard rounding the adjacent angle.</p>

<p>“Back!” whispered Scarred Eagle, in a tone of startling
earnestness.</p>

<p>Quickly as the order was obeyed, the canoes had hardly
turned, when the foremost was struck by another containing
half a dozen Miami warriors.</p>

<p>Instantly a burst of wild yells rung out, and were echoed
back from the adjacent banks; and, at the same instant,
“crash! crash!” rung the blows of hatchets. There was no
time to level a rifle; no time to push back into the cavern
without a struggle.</p>

<p>Six against four! Unfortunately, Revel, at the first onset,
received a blow which laid him powerless in the canoe.
His fall, while it made the odds more fearful, caused the canoe
to surge back, and at that moment Brom, pushing his rifle forward,
fired, killing one of the assailants, who fell back into
the water. The incident gave the other three time to snatch
up their rifles; but by this time another canoe was approaching
rapidly.</p>

<p>The rangers were not permitted to level their rifles, for the
assailants, knowing that aid was at hand, recovered in time to
beat down the weapons, springing in with their hatchets to
the attack.</p>

<p>“That’s it—quick boy—git us apart!”</p>

<p>The hoarse exclamation of Scarred Eagle, as with his two
companions, he made almost superhuman efforts to beat back
the assailants. The endeavors of Brom were somewhat aided
by Revel, who began to recover from the effects of the blow.
Even then, it seemed impossible to get clear of the assailants
before the latter should receive aid. But suddenly their canoe
was tipped backward by an unseen hand, and the warriors,
losing their balance, tumbled into the water. One of them
was dispatched by Mace. At that moment, a form appeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>beside Brom’s canoe, and a voice shouted:</p>

<p>“Me—White Fox—take in quick—Goodbrand!”</p>

<p>Moorooine identified the speaker in time to stay the arm
of Brom, raised to strike a supposed enemy.</p>

<p>As Goodbrand sprung in, the voice of Scarred Eagle was
heard above the din:</p>

<p>“Hyar they come; give them a volley or we’re lost!”</p>

<p>Another canoe was sweeping up, the occupants paying no
attention to their companions in the water. Not two rifle-lengths
separated them as Scarred Eagle spoke. Almost immediately
the four rangers fired, doing fearful execution; then,
taking advantage of the confusion, they swept back toward
the subterranean chamber.</p>

<p>But the Indians, now reinforced by another party in canoes,
soon followed. The rangers had barely effected a landing
when they found two or three canoes within twenty yards of
the retreat. One of them carried a torch.</p>

<p>“The devils know our weepons ar’ empty, an’ don’t mean
to give us time. Load quick, and if they come too soon, club
y’ur rifles!”</p>

<p>As the veteran scout issued this command he himself began
to reload, the rest following suit.</p>

<p>“Quick! here come!” suddenly exclaimed Moorooine.</p>

<p>As she spoke she darted back, and a canoe rounded the
turn, the torch in its prow revealing the cave and inmates distinctly.</p>

<p>“Hyar they be—beat back the devils!” shouted Scarred
Eagle and Mace together.</p>

<p>As quick as thought their clubbed rifles came down upon
the occupants of the foremost canoe, some of whom in their
wild rage had attempted to leap into the chamber. Yells,
cries and groans rung out through the dark depths, presenting
a scene of the wildest confusion. The Indians pressing in the
rear let fly another volley of arrows, but most of them passed
over the heads of the assailed, who had temporarily beaten
back those in the foremost canoe. At this instant a heavy
object fell with a crash in one of the canoes, striking down
some of its occupants, and tipping it over.</p>

<p>“Thet’s it—the rocks,” shouted Mace.</p>

<p>“Ay, dthim’s dthe boys. Musha, take dthat, ye haithens.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>Och, we’ll bate dthem wud sthones, so!”</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to describe it, the Irishman had
inaugurated this species of warfare. There were plenty
of loose rocks in the chamber, and the rangers hurled these
so rapidly among the crowd of assailants that the latter were
glad to withdraw out of range as quick as possible. The
moment they did so the rangers began again to reload, a torch
left in a remote corner of the room affording sufficient light.
They could hear their assailants still moving away in the darkness.</p>

<p>The rangers now had time to glance at each other, and question
Goodbrand, whose timely aid ten minutes previous had
probably saved them all from capture or death. His statement
was brief. His companion, Joe Hill, had escaped, while he
himself had been struck down with a hatchet as he ran. Being
brought forward and recognized, they were about to sacrifice
him on the spot, so great was their rage; but at that moment
came the shots fired by Revel and Mace upon those endeavoring
to force the passage. In the increased rush to this
spot only three or four were left around Goodbrand. While
the attention of these was for a moment diverted, the thongs
with which Goodbrand was bound were cut, and he recognized
the whisper of Noochekin in his ear:</p>

<p>“Me pay back you now for savin’ my life on the lake. If
catch ag’in you die. Debt paid now. Go.”</p>

<p>He darted away, and was pursued, Noochekin himself
joining in the chase. The latter stumbled over a log, retarding
the rest, till Goodbrand disappeared behind a lodge.
Thence he crept under a jut of the bank, where he lay, till
fearing discovery, he dropped under the water, intending to
swim into the chamber. As we have seen, he was in time to
aid his friends.</p>

<p>“Then the canoe side o’ the entrance must ’a’ be’n watchin’
for ye?” said Scarred Eagle.</p>

<p>“No—watchin’ for <em>you</em>,” was the answer. “It come round
the jut as me started to swim. They mistrusted some trick,
an’ meant if <em>was</em> in here you shouldn’t git ’way.”</p>

<p>“It must be—yes, Goodbrand; you’re right. The devils
hev be’n beat too bad to neglect watchin’ any p’int which
may look ’s ’ough we mout take advantage of it. We’re in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>our last corner, chaps, an’ thar’s no need o’ denyin’ it; but
we’ll rest awhile, ef the scamps ’ll let up, an’ prepare to meet
’em when they come. ’Twon’t be soon, uther, ’cos they kain’t
but see they’ve got us.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but the hellions ’ll r’member these last two days,”
said Mace, grimly. “No danger of their comin’ at us ag’in
right away. They’ll wait till we’re as weak as babies from
hunger, an’ then try ter git the hull <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse</i> on us <em>alive</em>! We
mout ’s well keep it up, an’ git our deaths by fightin’.”</p>

<p>“It’s better’n to be kilt alive at dthe sthake!” assented Devine,
with a shudder.</p>

<p>“Time enough to begin another scrimmage; thar’s no danger
but that the entrance ’ll be guarded close enough now,”
answered Scarred Eagle. “But we’d best recruit as best we
kin, so’s to hev our strength collected for the last trial. Thar’s
jest a chance some on us may git off, though it’s a small one.
D’ye see a light ahead, boy?”</p>

<p>The question was addressed to Brom, who stood beside
Moorooine in the end of the canoe, peering back through the
passage.</p>

<p>“No!” was the response; “but thar’s several canoes hovering
outside the entrance, in the starlight. They ain’t a-goin’
to come back here right away.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. What is it, Revel?”</p>

<p>The latter had crept up into the other passage, and now returned.</p>

<p>“The scamps are <em>filling up</em> the passage,” he said.</p>

<p>“Ay—’cos it’ll be easier to watch the other way. They
needn’t ’a’ took the pains.”</p>

<p>He saw that Revel, after waiting a moment, made a silent
gesture for him to come forward. He followed him up into
the passage as far as it had been cleared from the inside.
Revel carried a new torch, and by its light revealed a crevice
which he had discovered. Then, putting the torch behind
them, they could distinguish, at about ten feet distant, the
starlight from outside.</p>

<p>“I thought of this just now,” said Revel, “and came up to
look again. I discovered it at the time you came after us to
escape in the canoes. Now that that chance is gone, here’s
another. What do you think of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“One man workin’ outside, where thar’s room, mout, in two
hours, make the place big enough for us to creep out,” said
Rhodan. “To git outside—thet’s the hull question. One on
us mout try it.”</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>Turning they saw Mace and Goodbrand, who had crept up.
The matter was at once explained.</p>

<p>“If one could git out, what chances ’ud thar be to work
’ithout bein’ seen or heard? Thet’s the second question,”
said Mace.</p>

<p>“The side we’re lookin’ through is opposite the spot whar
the reds ’ll be likely to keep any sort of watch. Besides,
they’ve jist filled up the hole above us, so, if one on us <em>could</em>
git outside unseen, thar’d be a chance. An’ it seems as
’ough one might. Let us get down an’ consider the chances.”</p>

<p>They returned into the chamber, meeting the others, to
whom was communicated what had been discovered. Instantly
they began to devise some expedient by which one
might leave the subterranean region, and what one of them
should undertake the desperate feat.</p>

<p>Goodbrand insisted on having the task. His color, and
readiness with the Indian tongue, caused his request to be
unanimously granted. But now, how was he to steal out
without it being known by the waiting enemy?</p>

<p>“Thar’s no airthly way but to move up an’ engage the
reds in a skirmish,” said Scarred Eagle. “We must do it
in such a way that Goodbrand can slip noiselessly into the
water an’ swim for it. He’ll hev tu turn to the right of the
entrance an’ endivor to git a chance to draw himself up on
the rocks. Ef he kin manage that far, the rest’ll be easier.”</p>

<p>“Thar’s another thing,” said Brom. “What can he carry
to work with?”</p>

<p>There was a short silence. They had nothing with which
Goodbrand could work among the seamy rocks except knives
and hatchets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="p75">AGAIN!</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> did not pause long. True, the chance of Goodbrand’s
doing any thing was small even should he succeed in
reaching the spot. But it was better than no chance at all
and something else might occur to him by which to assist
his friends.</p>

<p>The canoes were again made ready, and the party, with
their weapons in good order, entered. They could quite
plainly see the canoes of the Indians outside, while they
knew it was impossible for themselves to be seen until they
should approach quite near the entrance.</p>

<p>Slowly they stole forward, making no noise that could be
heard outside, above the monotonous roar of the channel.</p>

<p>As they advanced they could see the Indians more plainly.
There were three canoes of them, and a constant stream of
inquiries and answers was kept up with those on shore.</p>

<p>They evidently feared the rangers were preparing to make
some desperate attempt to dash out. They had had abundant
evidence of their power of resource in danger, and
meant to leave no way open.</p>

<p>The rangers understood this, and felt it was all the more
favorable for the success of their plan.</p>

<p>The foremost canoe, directed by Scarred Eagle, at last
came to a stop. Twenty yards further would reveal them
to those outside.</p>

<p>For a moment the rangers consulted in low tones on the
chances of actually making a dash past their enemies. The
three canoes of the Indians were somewhat to the left of
the entrance. But if they should get past these there were
enough Indians standing along the banks to riddle them before
they could get any thing of a start. So they gave it
up, and Goodbrand prepared for his desperate work.</p>

<p>The canoes of the rangers now rested in the middle of
the channel. Goodbrand, shaking hands with his companions,
let himself silently into the water and in a few seconds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
swam to the right wall, and as far up as it was safe to do.
Glancing <em>toward</em> the light, his friends could make out the
outlines of his form as he sought for a place to rest until
the proper moment should arrive.</p>

<p>In a few moments they saw that he remained motionless,
and waited for his signal. This was to have been a waving
of his arm thrice. But the moments sped on and no signal
came.</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle was about to push up nearer, when he observed
Goodbrand relinquish his hold, and in a moment the
latter had noiselessly swum back.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Goodbrand?”</p>

<p>“No trouble,” he said. “Something good. Follow me
close up. Some chance all get way—cheat all the warriors
<em>now</em>. If mistook, then we can try other way jes’ same.” And
without waiting for reply, Goodbrand let go the side of the
canoe and swam back, as silently as before.</p>

<p>Word was passed to Brom, who was in the rear with Moorooine
and the Irishman. Then the canoes were turned, and
pushed close up beside the friendly Miami.</p>

<p>As yet the shouts and inquiries of the enemy were kept up
from shore and stream. Their canoes remained in nearly the
same position, and a continuous watch was maintained over
the entire surface of water adjacent to the dark entrance.</p>

<p>“Here!” whispered Goodbrand as they came up. “Give
me ramrod—quick!”</p>

<p>Taking one from the hands of Mace, he pushed it up in a
slanting direction through a fissure in the rocks. The gaze
of the rest following his movement, met a beam of pale light
coming through the hole made in the loose earth above. By
it they were enabled to see that the fissure was large enough
for them to crawl through, and that the covering of earth
above could be easily removed.</p>

<p>For a moment after making this discovery they remained
inactive. The chance of escaping so unexpectedly presented,
thrilled them one and all. And yet a single mishap might
rob them of it forever and fatally.</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle was the first to speak, which he did in a low
whisper, as if fearful it might be heard above the noise of the
subterranean passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“We must arrange carefully. Can you creep in thar by
standin’ on my shoulder, Goodbrand?”</p>

<p>“Yis, easy; quick. Easy to move the earth above. Den
we can keep below slope of bluff, an’ not be seen.”</p>

<p>“Understand then. You go first. If them out yonder
come this way for any cause, all that ar’ left here at the time
’ll scull back after firin’ into the enemy. After that, failin’ to
hear any one outside the passage from the chamber, it shell
be taken as a signal that this way is yit secret, and that help
is waitin’ hyar. Now—stiddy the canoe, men, while Goodbrand
mounts ahead.”</p>

<p>The latter, stepping upon the shoulder of Rhodan, easily
got within the fissure, and began to clamber up. It was necessary
to go scarcely his length, however, when he encountered
the covering of earth.</p>

<p>“Be keerful!” admonished Scarred Eagle. “Don’t let any
of the earth fall back, nor a stone.”</p>

<p>The most intense and painful anxiety now prevailed. So
near to escape on one hand, and to capture and death on the
other.</p>

<p>Goodbrand worked forward cautiously. Gradually he removed
the slight barrier of earth, and they saw him push his
head through, and knew he was taking a rapid survey of the
bluff. In a moment he settled back, and turning his head,
whispered:</p>

<p>“All clear—come on!”</p>

<p>Having warned them, he moved again, and in a moment
had passed entirely out, throwing himself flat upon the ground
outside.</p>

<p>With beating hearts the rest prepared to follow. Moorooine
was assisted up, and began to crawl forward. Revel was the
next in order, Scarred Eagle refusing to go till the last. But
before Revel had a chance to ascend, a movement was heard
outside in the starlight, and looking out they saw a canoe of
the Indians in motion.</p>

<p>“Git y’ur rifles ready!” muttered Scarred Eagle, in a low
tone. “It’s impossible to tell what they’re goin’ to do, but—”</p>

<p>“Hold stiddy for y’ur lives—<em>Moorooine?</em>”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Brom, sufficiently loud to reach the girl’s
ears without being heard by the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“What?” she answered.</p>

<p>“Lie still where you be—don’t move a hand’s breadth or
the reds may notice the light which your body now hides!”</p>

<p>He spoke as rapidly as possible, then turned to watch the
canoe. This was moving as though again to enter the depths
of the passage.</p>

<p>“Hish!” muttered Scarred Eagle, bending forward.</p>

<p>“Tell ye it’s time ter take the <em>oars</em>!” remonstrated Mace,
excitedly. “We mustn’t be diskivered in this spot! Ef we
be, our chance is gone here, sartin!”</p>

<p>“As long as they’ve no torch we’re safe from that, yit,” remarked
Rhodan. “They’ve got to pass ahind us before they
can see us. Ah—now—silence for y’ur lives!”</p>

<p>The occupants of the approaching canoe, five in number,
swept their bark suddenly aside not ten yards above the rangers,
and began to glide toward them. Rhodan at once divined
their object. It was not to again penetrate to the rocky
chamber, but to gain a position where they could see if a light
was visible therefrom.</p>

<p>It was too late for the rangers to move back without being
heard. Nor did Scarred Eagle wish to. He had hopes that
he could remain undiscovered, and that the explorers would
soon turn back. If not, he was confident of being able to
worst the fellows, and make good his retreat before others
could interfere.</p>

<p>With their own canoes pressed close to the wall, and ready
to use paddle or rifle as occasion might warrant, the borderers
awaited developments with bated breath. Nearer came the
canoe of the warriors, and lower crouched the whites. Suddenly
the canoe stopped. It was so near that the rangers,
looking <em>toward</em> the light, could make out the forms of its occupants
peering forward into the darkness. For several moments
they remained thus; then, dropping back upon foot and
knee they swept back, and rejoined the others.</p>

<p>The rangers lost no time in making their exit from the
place. One by one they ascended till only Scarred Eagle was
left. Seizing the hand of Mace, he was assisted up, and in
five minutes after the Indians had withdrawn, all of the whites
were gliding away toward the opposite side of the bluff.</p>

<p>It was now considerably past midnight, and heavy clouds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
began to drift across the sky, rendering the starlight dim indeed.
The little party soon halted at the edge of the water
on the other side. They could plainly hear the excited jabber
of Indian tongues behind them, and knew that no time was
to be lost.</p>

<p>But how to escape from the bluff was the question now.
To their right, after ascending the bluff, lay the deep forest.
An attempt to escape that way would expose them to great
danger, as it was quite certain some of the Miamis would be
hovering near the place. Not a canoe was to be had, and
not a log could be found on which to float to the forest further
south.</p>

<p>After a short consultation Scarred Eagle and Mace left the
rest, and ascended the bluff to reconnoiter. Goodbrand and
Revel, moving apart, kept as sharp watch as possible around
the left curve of the bluff toward the subterranean passage.</p>

<p>“Dthere must be a way for us now dthat we have got so
fur out of it,” said Tim at length. “Och musha, me head!”</p>

<p>“I b’l’eve thar will, Tim,” replied Brom, who was supporting
Moorooine, into whose willing ears he had been whispering.
“You’ve had a hard one over gittin’ me clear. If
I k’n ever pay ye back—”</p>

<p>“Luk, now!” interrupted the Irishman. “Sthop, ef yees
don’t want to rise me. Is it of pay y’ur goin’ to talk, an’ to
Tim Devine? Yees know betthur. Wouldn’t yees do as
much for me, an’ more? We done dthe besht we c’u’d,
though. Poor Dan Hicks! Och, musha! B’ated down;
an’ him skulped before me very eyes!”</p>

<p>The poor fellow’s voice trembled with emotion.</p>

<p>“It’s b’en an onusual adventur’,” remarked Brom. “Of
course we all mean to stick to each other. Thar’s three lost,
not to speak of Hill. I hope ’e made good ’is escape. He
couldn’t ’a’ done nothin’ for us. Thar wouldn’t ’a’ b’en one
us alive ef ’t hadn’t b’en for—”</p>

<p>“—Dthe wan beside yees—why don’t ye spake it?” said
the Irishman, as Brom paused. “Yes, God bless ’er. She’s
a haro to dthe core, and wan I’d shed me besht blood for—thrue’s
me father was a docthur w’u’d I. I what, they’re
coomin’ back, an’ now I’m in hopes dthurt a way to l’ave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>dthis divule’s ragion.”</p>

<p>Not for a moment had Brom and his companions ceased to
keep a sharp watch about them, and their brief conversation
had been carried on in whispers. As Tim spoke, Revel and
Goodbrand came up.</p>

<p>“The reds mistrust something, for they’ve started into the
cave with torches,” said Revel. “Less move forward.”</p>

<p>“Thin we’ll hear from dthim soon, I’m thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“They’ll see the canoes we left, an’ that’ll tell the story.”</p>

<p>“It will, onless, as may happen, the canoes drifted down
beyond the chamber,” said Brom. “In that case they’ll leave
us a little more time.”</p>

<p>They were creeping cautiously up in the direction taken
by the elder scouts. These had now been gone nearly half
an hour. Suddenly Goodbrand, who was some paces ahead,
put back his hand and sunk to the earth, the rest speedily
following his example.</p>

<p>What had he discovered? In a few moments the question
was answered. Three dark forms began to loom into view,
dealing down the slope of the bluff. The rangers did not
attempt even to exchange a hurried whisper. There was no
need, for each of them comprehended the situation, and held
the same theory. In some way Scarred Eagle and Mace had
aroused the suspicion of these warriors, but evaded them.
The latter, to satisfy their curiosity, were searching over the
ground where they suspected an enemy had lurked.</p>

<p>The concealed party well knew why these warriors made
no outcry. They could have no suspicion, as yet, that any
of the whites who had been driven into the subterranean
passage, had escaped. But the latter might have companions
watching for a chance to render them aid.</p>

<p>Nearer they came, glancing sharply around, and stepping
so lightly that they seemed like moving phantoms instead of
living forms. Brom and his companions lay as silently as
death, hoping to escape detection by these prowlers. All
knew that an outcry or struggle could hardly fail of being
heard beyond the bluff, and would at once bring others to the
spot. But they held themselves ready for a quick struggle,
if it should prove necessary.</p>

<p>The three Indians were several paces apart, and paused
every moment in their course, listening keenly. In this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
manner they passed the little party, who lay so close to the
ground that only the closest inspection could reveal them.</p>

<p>Brom, who lay furthest to the right, began to move aside,
and the others followed his example. In a moment or two,
all were crouched beneath the shelter of a scraggy spruce,
under which the Indian spies had already searched. The
outlines of the latter could now barely be seen passing around
the curve of the bluff; but they did not pass out of sight.
As if satisfied that their ears or sight had deceived them, they
turned back after a short pause, directly toward the whites.</p>

<p>But the latter had already moved on, nearly in single file,
keeping the spruce between them and the warriors. Suddenly
a whisper, which they recognized as Rhodan’s, warned
them aside. They were in time to dodge behind a protuberance
of the bluff as the Indian spies loomed into view between
them and the spruce.</p>

<p>“Don’t show a limb!” whispered Scarred Eagle. “Ef I
move, all on ye foller, an’ be sure to use no weepons unless
they see us first. These ’ere mustn’t be allowed to make an
outcry.”</p>

<p>A few seconds after the delivery of this order, the spies
came on boldly. They were passing a yard or two below the
party, when they suddenly halted and gazed out over the
water. Looking <em>downward</em>, they could distinguish nothing;
but they had heard some sound, as of a body moving through
the water. They at once glided down close to the edge of
the shore.</p>

<p>Scarred Eagle had also heard the slight sound, and well
knew it was Mace swimming forward and pushing a log before
him. The sound had ceased now, and he felt sure the
latter was aware of the presence of the three warriors. Had
they discovered him?</p>

<p>They squatted down close to the water and remained motionless.
Minute after minute passed, and still they moved
not. The hearts of the rangers began to beat wildly. At
any moment their absence from the cave might be discovered,
when the entire bluff would be surrounded and searched
closely. And in a little more than an hour it would be
<em>light</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“We kain’t wait longer, nor we kain’t avoid a tussle with
these chaps below us,” whispered Rhodan to Brom. “It’s
Mace out thar, with a log brought from across the angle of
water. The hull of us must steal onto them chaps. Pass
word to the rest, an’ remember we must take ’em without
raisin’ an alarm, or lose the lives we’ve brought so fur out o’
the jaws o’ death!”</p>

<p>From one to another was the order passed. Then as silently
as a shadow, the veteran scout rose with Brom and
Revel at his left. Foot by foot they crept toward the spies,
whose attention to the water seemed completely absorbed. A
sudden dash from behind, and they found themselves thrown
to the earth, while bands of iron clasped their throats. At
this moment a movement, heard a few yards out, told that
Mace comprehended the scene, and was pushing in with the
log.</p>

<p>The captured spies were stout fellows, and expecting death,
made every endeavor to struggle or cry out. But those who
came behind threw themselves across their bodies, while Moorooine,
with the remnants of a blanket, assisted to gag them.
While this was going on, Mace reached the shore with the
section of a tree-trunk.</p>

<p>“What! End the devils an’ done with it,” he said, savagely,
drawing a knife as he spoke over one of the captives.</p>

<p>“Hold!” said Scarred Eagle, catching his arm. “Put that
spirit out of ye, Ben; enough blood has b’en spilt, an’ this is
onnecessary. An’ remember <em>these</em>!” he added, nodding toward
Goodbrand and Moorooine.</p>

<p>The other understood him, and hurriedly began to secure
their rifles and ammunition on the heavy log, Goodbrand and
Tim assisting. The spies were securely bound, and placed
so that they would not easily be discovered in the gloom.
At this moment several dark figures were discovered on the
slope above moving down toward them!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="p75">IN THE TOILS.</span></h2></div>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Cling</span> to the log, an’ push off!” whispered Scarred Eagle.
“We must be quick or all his lost!”</p>

<p>The party darted as silently as possible to their places,
Rhodan and Ben Mace at either end of the log. In a moment
longer they were drifting outward, swimming as fast as
they were able. Moorooine and Devine kept their glance behind,
being hurriedly directed to give notice when the Indians
should come down to the water.</p>

<p>“Now—they most there,” said the girl, in a whisper.</p>

<p>All ceased their exertions, for it was impossible to proceed
without disturbing the water sufficient to attract attention.
The most lively apprehensions now filled their minds. Would
the new-comers at once discover their bound comrades? They
were coming on in a line that would bring them within half
a dozen yards of the latter. But suddenly pausing, they
separated, two going to the right and two toward the left.</p>

<p>“S’archin’ for them that we took!” said Rhodan. “They
think t’others ar’ too long away. We kin begin to move
ag’in.”</p>

<p>The log was again pushed forward slowly, in order not to
attract the notice of the new-comers. As these moved further
away, the whites renewed their speed, pushing out with all
their strength. But a sudden loud splashing came to their
ears, and glancing back, they were able to discover that one
of the bound warriors had, by desperate exertions, got his
feet sufficiently loose to work around and strike them in the
water. The noise attracted the attention of the others, who
were already rushing back.</p>

<p>The men now put forth an almost superhuman strength, in
their efforts to push the log forward. They had no doubts
their whereabouts would soon be known, and a wide-spread
alarm given. Full sixty yards were yet between them and the
opposite shore. All would depend on their reaching it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
time. They could hear a rush of feet around the east side
of the bluff; but as yet, no sounds of alarm came. What
could this mean? Were not the bound spies yet found?</p>

<p>Once, as Moorooine glanced behind, she fancied she saw a
canoe rounding the bluff. She hastily communicated her suspicions
to the rest, inciting them, if possible, to greater exertions.</p>

<p>Straining every muscle in the work, the little party soon
landed on the shore. Hastily securing their arms, they entered
the dark woods. Without expressing it, all wondered
that so little commotion had been heard from the bluff.
Could it be possible that the Indians were not yet aware that
their prey had escaped? Before moving forward they glanced
back. To their dismay, they saw three or four canoes darting
toward them, spreading apart as they came on, and occasionally
displaying torches, which gave a clear view over the
adjacent waters.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the little party comprehended the situation at
the same moment, and it caused a terrible reaction of disappointment.
Not only was their escape known, but it had
probably been discovered before, or about the time they had left
the shore of the bluff. As far as possible, the Indians had
restrained all notes of alarm, and gone to work silently, that
their escaping victims might not know of the pursuit.</p>

<p>No sooner had the lights been displayed, than the long-suppressed
shouts broke forth from river and forest. Nothing
more was needed to confirm the fact that the doomed whites
were surrounded. The Indians on the river had detected the
floating log, and knew their victims were within the circle.
It was evident, the entire force of the village was abroad, determined
this time to prevent the possibility of their escape.</p>

<p>“Thar’s only one thing,” said Scarred Eagle, hurriedly,
and yet coolly. “The circle ’round us is a big one, an’ they
won’t be in a hurry ’bout closin’ it up, when daylight ’ll so
soon show things plain. We must separate. Some on us
may git off, but I needn’t say it’s onsartin. Ah, well, whatever’s
the will o’ Providence we must give in tew. Come, boy, an’
you tew, girl! We three ’ll keep together, be our fates good
or bad; ’cos I know it’s y’ur wish as it is mine. The rest kin go
separate ways, an’ each trust to his own gifts an’ a Higher
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>Power!”</p>

<p>The trio moved silently away in the gloom, Brom tightly
clasping the hand of the Indian girl. He soon became convinced
the others kept together, and were following on a
parallel course to their own, and a few yards to their left. All
commotion had now ceased, and the silence was most thrilling.
They had absolutely to feel their way, and knew not when a
lurking foe might spring upon them. Each one carried a
hatchet in one hand, and the deadly knife in the other. As
they advanced down the line of shore, an occasional ray of
light was reflected from the torches on the river. But at last
these were no longer to be seen. No doubt those in the
canoes were posted at intervals a short distance from the
banks, listening for the movements of the fugitives.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rhodan paused, and turned to Brom and the girl.</p>

<p>“’Twon’t last much longer, boy,” he said. “Ef we don’t
meet some o’ the reds soon, daylight ’ll be upon us afore long
at best. For myself it’s no gr’et matter, ’cos, beyond the
nat’rul desire to live, I’ve no gr’et object to live <em>for</em>, ’cept the
good o’ you an’ my brave girl here.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, they noticed he had laid down his trusty rifle,
retaining only his other weapons.</p>

<p>“An’ now,” he added, “I’m off toward the right, hyar.
The minnit ye hear a shout an’ a rush, you two put nor’-west.
Mind to bear a trifle toward the village at first, an’ then keep
on to y’ur left, ’cordin’ as ye judge the way is clear. Ye
<em>may</em> git off!”</p>

<p>He grasped a hand of each, and then attempted to turn,
but they clung to his hard hands.</p>

<p>“No, Rhodan!” said Brom, hoarsely. “’Twon’t work.
You’d go to sartin death, an’ ye know it. An’ to save us!
No—stay; you kin help this girl out <em>alone</em>, better’n I could.
She’s ’s dear ter me as life, an’ she shell be saved. I’ll go
an’ bein’ younger—”</p>

<p>“No—me go too, den!” said Moorooine. “Hark! Warriors
not far that way now. You shall no die for me. Do no
good if did. We better die together. See—thar one come!”</p>

<p>Before another word could be passed, a figure loomed up
beside them, and the voice of Mace whispered:</p>

<p>“Come out here, Scarred Eagle. Goodbrand has stole down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>toward the bank, where the lights last showed a canoe.”</p>

<p>“Ay, I know what the Miami wants to ondertake; but
too <em>many</em> mustn’t try it, even ef thar’s an atom uv a chance.
I don’t say thar ain’t. Go back with Mace then, you two,”
he added, addressing Brom and the Indian maiden. “What
I hev spoke of ’ll be of advantage to ye even in that case.”</p>

<p>“What, Rhodan?”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ ter stir up the devils that ar’ hoverin’ out here,”
said the other, as he stripped his wet hunting-frock. “Go on
with ’im, Brom, an’ the girl too.”</p>

<p>“But, Rhodan—”</p>

<p>“Don’t waste time,” he interrupted. “I’m detarmined on
this, ’cos it’s for your good, an’ the hull on us.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go in for the same stretegy,” said Mace. “Go
quick, Brom. Ye’ll find Revel an’ the Irishman jist back
hyar. Goodbrand ’ll be back in a minit, to lead ye to the
water. I’ll creep lower down, an’ raise a row at the right
time. Am I right, Scarred Eagle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, go!” said the latter.</p>

<p>As he spoke, the three exchanged a hurried clasp. The
next moment Rhodan glided away in one direction, Mace in
another. Brom, tenderly clasping the hand of Moorooine,
pressed toward the spot indicated by Mace.</p>

<p>In a few moments he found Devine and Revel, who seemed
to be expecting them. Hastily communicating the plans of
the others, the four at once relapsed into silence as they
waited for the return of Goodbrand.</p>

<p>The moments, so full of fearful suspense, seemed hours.
The darkness, meantime, seemed to deepen, as it often does
just before daybreak. Not the slightest sound yet broke the
solemn stillness; yet they were conscious that all around
them foes were lurking, or crawling forward, ready to pounce
upon their victims.</p>

<p>They strained their eyes toward the dark line of water
just visible below them. Suddenly a light flashed out whose
rays penetrated nearly up to the little ascent upon which
they stood. It was gone in a moment, leaving a blacker
darkness around.</p>

<p>But the light, though momentary as that of a lightning-flash,
had disclosed a canoe close up to the bank, in which
were five warriors. And the watchers were in time to notice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
that this canoe was below the others, which were grouped
one above another, to the south angle of the bluff above.</p>

<p>It was evident, then, that the Indians supposed the fugitives
were hidden directly opposite them, and that, attempting
to pass up, down, or back, their capture would be inevitable.
And should they, in sheer desperation, take to
the water, sharp eyes and ears were watching in anticipation.</p>

<p>Nearly five minutes had now passed and still Goodbrand
came not. He must have just seen the light, giving him the
very knowledge he evidently sought. What was detaining
him?</p>

<p>Brom leaned back, and without taking his eyes from the
direction of the river, whispered:</p>

<p>“Either Goodbrand is took, or has found some o’ the reds
atween us an’ him. What d’ye say, Revel? I think we
mout’s well be movin’ toward the way Mace has gone!”</p>

<p>His only answer was a grip upon his arm, and a whisper
in his very ear:</p>

<p>“Be careful an’ very ready! A warrior come—very
close—behind us only very little.”</p>

<p>Brom turned silently. Just behind him crouched Revel
and Devine, whom the keen-sensed Indian girl had similarly
warned. She herself had slowly leaned against a tree, and
inclining his body toward her, Brom sunk to foot and knee!</p>

<p>For half a minute the dread silence continued. Brom
began to fear his whisper had been heard beyond the ears of
his companions. Ah! There comes a movement—hardly perceptible
is the sound, but still enough to show that an enemy
is almost beside them. A gesture from Moorooine reveals
the fact that a warrior is upon the opposite side of the tree!</p>

<p>It is a fearful moment, but prompt action is necessary.
Brom straightens up and leans forward with drawn knife. His
intention is to spring like lightning behind the tree and kill
the warrior if possible without giving the latter a chance to
cry out.</p>

<p>“Waugh!” comes at this moment a whispered exclamation
at the left, quickly followed by a few cautious words in the
Indian tongue. Turning his head he saw another Indian,
who stood so as to command a view of both sides of the
tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>As a lightning suspicion flashed through Brom’s mind, the
one behind the tree moved aside toward the new-comer,
uttering a few words as he passed. The next moment a long,
muscular arm clasped him from behind and a hand was upon
his throat. Then there followed a short, silent struggle,
and the warrior was pressed to the ground, stunned and
senseless from a heavy blow on his head!</p>

<p>“Now come quick!” whispered Goodbrand, excitedly. “If
don’t, some come ’tween us an’ shore!”</p>

<p>Silently and in single file they followed him. They were
within twenty paces of the bank when there came to their
ears the unmistakable sounds of a struggle at some distance behind.
As they dropped to the earth a smothered groan rung
out through the solemn depths, showing that Scarred Eagle
had encountered an enemy.</p>

<p>Instantly a light was seen flashing from the edge of the
water immediately in their front, and a rush was heard in the
direction of the sounds; then a shrill cry rung out below
them, ending in a groan that told of death. Several dark
forms leaped past, immediately in front of the fugitives, and
became lost in the gloom!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter nobreak">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="p75">A NOVEL EXPEDIENT.</span></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Goodbrand</span> rose to a half-stooping position and began to
glide forward again. The rest followed closely. In a moment
or two they all stopped, conscious they were within ten
feet of the edge of the bank.</p>

<p>The various sounds occasioned by the maneuvers of Scarred
Eagle and Mace had ceased. The fact was terribly significant
to all. The Indians were too fearful of the stratagem of the
whites to permit themselves to be drawn far away. They knew
a simultaneous rush would give some of their victims a chance
to escape, taking advantage of the darkness and noise.</p>

<p>Goodbrand had not communicated his plan in words, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
all understood it. It was to attempt to surprise and overpower
those in the canoe, and then try to escape on the river.
Wild and desperate as was the scheme, it promised better
than any other mode. The noble heroism of Scarred Eagle
and Mace had enabled them to get so far. Could they now
succeed?</p>

<p>A few thrilling moments passed; then Goodbrand, exchanging
a low whisper with Brom, began to worm himself forward
alone. The latter turned slightly, and communicated with
Moorooine, who in turn passed word to the men behind.
Then, silent as shadows all rose to their feet.</p>

<p>Hardly a minute passed when Goodbrand rose silently near
them.</p>

<p>“Canoe here!” he whispered. “Four warriors in it yit.
Their eyes and ears are wide open. Only one way to do.
Must do quick, for—hark! They’re goin’ more down
banks.”</p>

<p>“Let’s make the rush then,” said Brom, hoarsely. “’Tain’t
likely we shall succeed, but it’s our last chance. Is t’other
canoes near?”</p>

<p>“Not very. Above. Only see ’em when light comes.
There ’tis now.”</p>

<p>Again they crouched down. The light would otherwise
have revealed them in spite of the bushes separating them
from the edge of the river. In a moment it was concealed
again.</p>

<p>“Now our time!” whispered Goodbrand, rising.</p>

<p>“Hold!” whispered Brom.</p>

<p>A sudden, peculiar expedient had suggested itself.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>The young ranger did not answer at once. It was evident
the canoe was slowly moving down the bank. While they
listened it drew up a few yards below them.</p>

<p>“Goodbrand, now use your best wits. You know thar lingo.
Take Moorooine, and steal forward till you are quite near
them, then take her in your arms, an’ do you, dear girl, be
unconscious. Make ’em b’l’eve you’ve been took prisoner.
Goodbrand shall play your captor. He shall tell ’em ’e took
ye, and ask ’em out to make room for you. The rest of us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>’ll be on hand, if they take the bait, ur <em>don’t</em> take it!”</p>

<p>Brom spoke hurriedly. Goodbrand, by a gesture, signified
his approbation of the scheme. The Indian girl at once
moved to his side, and the two started forward toward the
canoe.</p>

<p>They gradually made themselves heard as they advanced.
The three men glided close behind. The warriors were on the
alert. Suddenly seeing one of their number, as they supposed,
they peered forward anxiously. At this moment Goodbrand,
clasping the form of Moorooine in his arms, addressed them
in panting tones:</p>

<p>“Step out quick! The Sporting Fawn is taken, and can
be kept in the canoe till the others are found. Their race for
life is nearly run!”</p>

<p>Suppressing a cry of triumph, the four warriors immediately
vacated the canoe, one of them steadying it for Goodbrand
to enter with his insensible prisoner. As the latter stepped
in he dropped his charge, and suddenly turning, struck down
the one holding the canoe. At the same instant the other
three were knocked headlong, just as they were in the act of
springing forward.</p>

<p>Like lightning the others sprung in beside Goodbrand and
Moorooine. Already had the former seized the paddles and
the canoe was now gliding down the bank. All this had not
been accomplished without some noise. One of the savages
had been knocked into the water, and the splash, coupled with
groans, rung out plainly. The fugitives had not moved ten
yards when lights from above flashed over the water, showing
them to those in the other canoes.</p>

<p>Instantly the most wild and alarming yells arose as the
canoes behind started in pursuit. The yells, answered from
the line of shore, were succeeded by a rush of feet.</p>

<p>“Out into the stream!” cried Brom, wildly.</p>

<p>“Look out—arrows comin’!”</p>

<p>“Och! murdher!”</p>

<p>“Give ’em yer rifles, quick!”</p>

<p>“Crack! crack-crack!”</p>

<p>“Now row with y’ur stocks—my God, <em>quick</em>, it’ll help some.”</p>

<p>Already Goodbrand and Moorooine had turned the canoe
and were propelling it with all their might, not ceasing for a
moment, though both of them had been struck by the arrows.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
To cease from their exertions now would be certain capture,
and setting their teeth hard, the whole party worked on,
taking the risk of being struck by those now rushing down to
the banks.</p>

<p>By some accident the torch in the prow of the foremost
canoe of the pursuers had been extinguished, again enveloping
the scene in darkness. A perfect Babel of shouts filled the
air, as if the Indians, aware that nearly all the fugitives were
before them, were concentrating all their energies to the work
of ending the protracted search at once. In the midst of the
din the pursued heard a splashing toward their right, showing
that a number had sprung into the water in their infuriated
surprise and eagerness, and a moment or two—just enough
for the contrast to disappear—the fugitives became conscious
daylight was dawning upon them.</p>

<p>“These jest behind ain’t gainin’ on us—push on, an’ <em>courage</em>!”
cried Brom.</p>

<p>“Ef we kin git inter the current furder out—ah, good
God, t’others are cuttin’ across that way!”</p>

<p>“Turn it, Goodbrand—turn it quick! We’ll work harder
ter strike the current furder down!”</p>

<p>“Luk out, the bows are coomin’ intil us. Murdher!”</p>

<p>The Irishman got an arrow through the back of his neck,
and it passed into the arm of Brom. The rest escaped the
volley as by a miracle, and the moment it passed sprung to
their task again.</p>

<p>All this time the space to the left and right, as well as behind
them, rung with malignant, crazy yells, defying description.
But having struck the main current they were now
making rapid headway, determined not to be diverted for a
second. They occasionally cast glances back, but not at
the expense of relaxing labor; yet they could not see that
those in the nearest canoe had lightened their craft by the
exit of three warriors, leaving three more to make accelerated
speed.</p>

<p>“Murdther—dthe Vargin purtict—here’s soom jist upon us!”
cried Devine, at last.</p>

<p>“The rest keep on for <em>life</em>, an’ we’ll look out for these,
Tim,” cried Brom. “If we stop a minit, the others ’ll overhaul
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>us—ha!”</p>

<p>Two rifles spoke from an adjacent bend of the bank, and
one of the nearest pursuers fell into the river.</p>

<p>“’Twas Rhodan an’ Ben!” shouted Brom and Revel, simultaneously.</p>

<p>“An’ dthe durned apes are b’ated in <em>dthat</em> game; whist—hoora!”
yelled the impulsive Irishman.</p>

<p>“Go in, boys! That’s it; they kain’t reach us from shore,
while these ahind hev spent thar arrers, an’ ain’t gainin’ a bit.
What—hold—turn the canoe in, Goodbrand, towarts the p’int
ahead; ef t’others ar’ thar, we’ll manage—”</p>

<p>“No—no!” cried the Indian. “Lose ground if do. We
got safe so fur, git safe longer!”</p>

<p>At this moment, Devine ceased his labor, and the canoe
lurched, nearly upsetting.</p>

<p>“Ha, Tim, what’s this? Ah, the brave chap’s—”</p>

<p>He ceased speaking, as he grasped the Irishman, who had
nearly fallen out. And no wonder. His terrible experiences
during the last twenty-four hours, his sufferings as a captive,
of which the rest knew little, and his last wound—all had
culminated at last, and the man of iron endurance had
fainted.</p>

<p>“Quick—good God!” exclaimed Brom, as he drew him in,
“we’ve lost by this. There they come!”</p>

<p>“Gi-gi—stoo—gi—<em>durn ye all</em>—stoop down, thar!” came
at this moment, in a ringing voice from shore.</p>

<p>All recognized it and huddled down, as two canoes, full of
their pursuers, surged up not three boat’s-lengths behind. The
next moment a dozen rifles rung out from the shore, followed
by despairing shouts and groans behind.</p>

<p>“Thank God! Hurrah for the victory!” shouted Brom, the
others joining in.</p>

<p>“Come i-i—<em>come in</em>!” shouted Joe Hill. “Ar’ ye all
thar?”</p>

<p>“All but Rhodan an’ Mace. Look for them up-shore.
Never mind us.”</p>

<p>And then, standing up, Brom pressed Moorooine to his breast,
without speaking.</p>

<p>The next instant, the canoe touched the shore, and a group
of hardy men waited to receive them, foremost among whom
were Scarred Eagle and Ben Mace!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“Ay, boy!” said the former, with a tremor in his voice,
“Providence has ordered that we ain’t yit to part.”</p>

<p>Still clasping the Indian girl, Brom put his hand tenderly
on Rhodan’s shoulder and undertook to speak, but his voice
failed him. They all met, as brothers long separated, the rescued
all grasping the hands of Scarred Eagle, Mace and Joe
Hill, in turn.</p>

<p>“Mebbe ye thought I’d de-de-<em>desarted</em> ye,” said Hill. “Ye
see what I war about. I met the advance of Bradstreet’s
army jist in time fur this. Hear that. Thar won’t many of
’em iscape!”</p>

<p>It was now light enough to distinguish objects plainly. Far
up the shore came the numerous reports of rifles, showing the
Indians were surprised and routed at every point. The noise
aroused Devine, who had been laid upon the ground, attended
by some of his companions.</p>

<p>“Courage, Tim, my boy!” said Scarred Eagle, bending
over him. “Ye’ve got among friends, an’ the inemy ar’
routed.”</p>

<p>“An’ is it y’ursilf to tell me dthat?” he answered, struggling
to his feet. “Good! I thought I was dead, so. Phare’s
dthe rist? Ah—all here, dthe Vargin be praised! Phat’s
dthat?”</p>

<p>“Good music!” said Mace. “It’s the shouts of the retreating
reds.”</p>

<p>“Och! musha! I’ve but wan ear,” said Tim, putting up his
hand with a grimace; “but it’s wilcome to sich music. Give
me a sup of wather, for I’m wake, jist.”</p>

<p>Something stronger was furnished to all of the rescued. As
the light increased, those in pursuit came back, forming a numerous
company. As the day advanced the main division of
the army came up and acting upon the report furnished by
the rescued scouts, prepared to advance to the relief of
the besieged fort. This was done, and the fort relieved
without a struggle. The followers of Pontiac, alarmed and
disheartened by repeated reverses, had abandoned the region.</p>

<p>In three days the scouts, now thoroughly recruited in
strength, returned to one of the border settlements. Here
Brom Vail and the beautiful and brave Miami maiden, whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
he loved, were united in Christian marriage. Scarred Eagle
and Goodbrand made their home with them, and Mace was
always a welcome visitor.</p>
